TODO:
-----

1) Write BoundaryAnalyzer, along with modifications of Boundary 
   required to make the analyzer generic.

2) Modify PairEnergyAnalyzer to allow averages for more than one
   pair component.

3) Modify StressAnalyzer so as to keep track of virial and kinetic
   separately.

4) Modify PressureAnalyzer so as to keep track of virial and kinetic
   separately.

5) Check atom shift flags, and design mean-squared displacement
   analyzers for individual atoms that makes use of them. (Center
   of mass of a molecule is harder, and still requires some
   post processing).
