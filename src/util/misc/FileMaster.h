   * A FileMaster manages input and output files for a simulation.
   *
   * <H4> File types </H4>
   *
   * A FileMaster manages a set of input and output files for a  
   * molecular simulation. It provides methods to open four different
   * types of file, which are located in different places within a 
   * standard directory structure. These file types are:
   *
   *   - Control files, i.e., parameter and command input files
   *
   *   - Restart files, which can be opened for input or output
   *
   *   - Input data files (e.g., input configuration files)
   *
   *   - Output data files (e.g., trajectories and analysis output files)
   *
   * Slightly different directory structures are used for file paths
   * in simulations of a single system and for parallel simulations 
   * of multiple systems, as discussed below. 
   * 
   * <H4> Single-system simulations </H4>
   *
   * In simulations of a single system, paths to the different types
   * of file are constructed by prepending some combination of the
   * following elements before a base file name:
   *
   *  - Root directory prefix: This is the path from the current
   *    working directory to the root level directory for all files
   *    associated with a simulation run. It defaults to an empty
   *    string. It may be set by calling the setRootPrefix() function.
   *
   *  - Input prefix: This string is prepended to the base name of
   *    all input data files. 
   * 
   *  - Output prefix: This string is prepended to the base name of
   *    all output data files. 
   * 
   * The root directory prefix must be a path to a directory and
   * thus must either be an empty string or must end with the 
   * directory separator "/". The input and output prefix are 
   * often also chosen to be directory paths, in order to place 
   * input and output files in different subdirectories (e.g., 
   * "in/" and "out/"), but can also be strings that are 
   * prepended to the base name for all input and output files.
   *
   * In simulations of a single systems, paths to both control
   * and restart files are constructed by the openControFile(),
   * openRestartIFile() and openRestartOFile() by concatenating
   * the root prefix (if any) to a base file name that is passed 
   * to the appropriate function. Paths to input and output files
   * are constructed by the openInputFile() and openOutputFile()
   * functions by concatenating the root prefix, if any, to the 
   * input or output prefix, as appropriate, and a base file 
   * name that is passed as as argument. 
   *
   * <H4> Multi-system simulations </H4>
   *
   * A parallel simulation of multiple systems use a directory
   * structure in which the root directory (specified by the root
   * directory prefix) contains a set of numbered subdirectories
   * named "0/", "1/", "2/", etc.. Each such numbered directory
   * contains input, output and restart files that are specific 
   * to a particular system, and will be referred to in what 
   * follows as the system directory for that system. The integer
   * index for the system associated with a specific MPI processor
   * must be set by the setDirectoryId() method.
   *
   * In all simulations of multiple systems, paths to input and
   * input and output data files are constructed by the functions
   * openInputFile() and openOutputFile() by concatenating the
   * system directory path, an input or output prefix, and a base
   * file name. Paths to restart files for each system are 
   * constructed by concatentaing the system directory path and
   * a base file name, thus placing these files in the system
   * directory. 
   *
   * Two different modes of operation are possible for simulations
   * of multiple systems, which differ in the treatment of control
   * files. In "independent" mode, simulations of multiple systems 
   * are assumed to be completely independent and to require separate
   * parameter and command control files for each system. In this
   * case, the openControlFile() system opens files in the numbered
   * system directory. In "replicated" model, all simulations are
   * controlled by a single parameter file and a single control
   * file, which are opened in the root directory. "Independent"
   * mode is enabled by default, and "replicated" mode may be chosen
   * by calling the function "setCommonControl()" before opening any
   * any control files. 
   *   
   * <H4> Control Files </H4>
   *
   * FileMaster provides several special functions for parameter and
   * command files. Names of the parameter and command files can be set 
   * by calling the setParamFileName() or setCommandFileName() functions,
   * respectively. If the setCommandFileName() function is not called
   * before readParameters(), the readParameters() function will
   * expect to find a "commandFileName" a the first parameter in the 
   * FileMaster parameter file block. After parameter and command file 
   * names have been set, the paramFile() and commandFile() functions
   * return references to the resulting parameter and command files.
   * The first time these functions are called, they each call
   * openControlFile() internally to open the appropriate file.
