->  Define a Cell:OffsetStrip : pair of (signed) cellId offset integers.
    Redefine Cell::OffsetArray -> array of OffsetStrip objects.

->  In findNeighbors, loop over strips rather than looping over cells.
    This change could be applied using the current cell definition.

->  In makeGrid, when choosing a cell size, choose a size that is 
    greater than or equal to (cutoff + skin)/(mCell) where 
    mCell >= 1 is an optional user input parameter.

->  In building Cell::OffSetArray, include all cells for which the
    closest corner is within the Verlet pair list cutoff.

-----

->  Create different instances of Cell::OffsetArray for different relationships 
    between cell and boundaries. 

->  For cells near a boundary, make separate Cell:OffsetArray objects for local 
    and ghost atoms. 

->  In Cell::findNeighbors, pass separate localNeighbors and ghostNeighbors
    arrays.

->  In PairList, treat local-local and local-ghost pairs entirely separately.
