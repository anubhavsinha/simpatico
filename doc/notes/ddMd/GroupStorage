Observations: 

1) Each GroupStorage containers is used only to calculate an associated
   potential contribution.

2) Additional specialized potential might require additional data 
   structures (e.g., impropers, angle-dependent H bonding forces, etc.)

3) It would be preferable to have each potential responsible for 
   controlling communication of group-like data structures it requires.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideas:

1) Make each GroupStorage a member of the associated potential.

2) Abstract distribution and collection of groups in a manner that can 
   be generalized to other potentials. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan (order of changes):

1) Make changes to Buffer first, to first move (pack|unpack)Group
   methods to Group<N> template, where they belong (Done).

2) Change all methods of Exchanger that involve GroupStorage 
   to methods of GroupStorage<N> (Done).

3) Create a GroupReference class as a generic group type for use by
   GroupExchanger, GroupDistributor and GroupCollector (not begun).

   This requires:

   - Modification of GroupExchanger and GroupStorage classes to provide
     functions that provide GroupReference objects.

   - Modifications of GroupDistributor and GroupCollector to use the
     new abstraction in implementation and interface.

4) Move GroupStorage to be a member of the corresponding Potential.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next Step:

  - See GroupReference for new generic group class.

  - See ConfigIos for discussion of changes in interface of 
    GroupCollector and GroupDistributor used in a ConfigIo.
