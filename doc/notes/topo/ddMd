Species data in DdMd::Simulation
--------------------------------

   - Create a new namespace with classes that define molecular structure. This could 
     be called Chem, or Topo, or Molec, etc. Use Chem:: in the following examples. 
     See file doc/notes/design for more detail.

   - Create a class DdMd::Species derived from (for example) Chem::MoleculeType.

   - The minimal data for each species that would be required to allow an analysis 
     program to validate that the atoms and groups are in molecule order would be 
     the number of molecules of each type, and the number of atoms, bonds, angles, 
     and dihedrals per molecule.

   - It would sometimes be useful to have more detailed information about topology, 
     but this is not strictly necessary in ddMd. Provide a hasTopology_ flag in 
     order to make this optional. 

   - We need a file format that can be used to exchange this structural information
     between programs.

   - Data structures: Define class Species. DdMd::Simulation could have a 
     DArray<DdMd::Species> species array, and a bool hasSpecies flag.

   - In Chem::MoleculeType or DdMd::Species, add members listing the first id for 
     atoms, bonds, etc. for each species. Provide functions allowing conversion 
     between molecule and local atom/group number and global atom/group ids. 
     Provide this in Chem::Species if it would be useful in more than one program.
