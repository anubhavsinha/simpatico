Priorities:

1) Script to create a standard directory structure, with numbered
   directories 0/ 1/ .... n/, and with in/ out/ out/dump in each.
   Should make copies of param and command files. Josh Mysona's 
   script is a good start for this. 

2) Extract average values from specific files in a set of numbered
   directories. Mysona's dataGrabber file is also a good start for this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts for manipulating data output files:

1) Class DataFile to read *.dat files. Should distinguish integers and 
   floats.  How to associate meaning with columns? Format file?

2) Class DataFilePlot to make plots from *.dat files. Subclass of DataFile.

3) Class AverageFile to read outputs from files that output averages.
