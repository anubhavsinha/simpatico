</p>
<p>Before discussing the parameter file formats for particular types of simulation, we discuss the syntax, which is similar for all Simpatico simulations. Let's start with an example:</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="param_syntax_mdexample_section"></a>
Example (for mdSim)</h2>
<p>Shown below is a complete parameter file for a relatively simple MD simulation, for use with mdSim. Other example parameter files for mcSim and ddSim are shown in subsequent pages, and many further examples can be found in the simpatico/examples/ directory.</p>
<p>This example sets up a simulation for a system that contains a mixture of two types of homogeneous linear polymers, which are represented by two instances of class <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Homopolymer.html" title="A Homopolymer species of chain molecules.">McMd::Homopolymer</a>. Each species has 8 atoms per molecule, and one species has atoms of type index 0 (or A), the other has atoms of type 1 (or B). Enough memory will be allocated when the program is initialized to accomodate up to 100 molecules of each type (moleculeCapacity = 100). The potential energy contains a Lennard-Jones (pairStyle = "LJPair") non-bonded pair interaction and a harmonic (bondStyle = "HarmonicBond") bond interaction between neighboring beads in each chain, with no angle or dihedral potentials. The simulation will use a constant energy (NVE) velocity-Verlet integration algorithm (an instance of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1NveVvIntegrator.html" title="An NVE Verlet molecular dynamics integrator.">McMd::NveVvIntegrator</a>) with a time step of dt = 0.005. </p>

File Format</h2>
<p>As seen in this example, a Simpatico parameter file consists of a set of nested blocks. Each block is delimited by lines containing opening and closing curly brackets, much like the syntax of a C program. Each block may contain both the values of individual parameters and nested subblocks. Each parameter is given by an entry containing a label string, which is the name of the parameter, followed by its value. Each block begins with a line containing a label for the block followed by an opening curly bracket, with no white space between them.</p>
<p>The order of appearance of elements within each block of a parameter file is generally fixed (i.e., hard-coded) by the implementation of the function that reads each block. The use of a fixed file format signficantly simplifies the design of the functions that read the parameter file, and check for errors in user input. This is one design decision in which programmer-friendliness and maintainability have been prioritized over end-user friendliness.</p>
<p>To make it easier for users to debug errors in the parameter file, Simpatico provides very explicit error messages in response to errors in the parameter file. If the expected label for a parameter or block is not found at the expected position in a parameter file, each Simpatico program will output a message indicating exactly what label was expected and what label was actually read, and then halt execution. These error messages are particularly easy to interpret if one uses the "-e" command line option when invoking the program. This option causes each block and parameter in the parameter file to be echoed to standard output immediately after it is read, thus allowing one to see exactly where in the file the error was encountered. As discussed below, the hierarchical nature of the file format is also designed to make it easy, if necessary, for a user to find the section of code that reads any section of the parameter file in order to resolve remaining ambiguities.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_param_syntax_block_section"></a>
Parameter Blocks</h2>
<p>The hierarchical nesting of blocks in a parameter file directly reflects the hierarchical organization of C++ objects in the underlying C++ code. Each block in the parameter file corresponds to a specific C++ object. In the Simpatico source code, objects are organized into a hierarchy in which each object can have any number of "children" but only one "parent". A child object is either a member variable of its parent or a dynamically allocated object that the parent is responsible for creating and destroying. Every object in this hierarchy is responsible for reading a corresponding block in the parameter file. The root node of this herarchy is the main simulation object, which is an instance of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1McSimulation.html" title="A Monte-Carlo simulation of one McSystem.">McMd::McSimulation</a> for mcSim simulations, <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSimulation.html" title="A molecular dynamics simulation of a single MdSystem.">McMd::MdSimulation</a> for mdSim simulations, or <a class="el" href="classDdMd_1_1Simulation.html" title="Main object for a domain-decomposition MD simulation.">DdMd::Simulation</a> for ddSim simulations.</p>
<p>The parameter file block associated with a C++ object normally contains all information necessary to initialize the state of that object, and of its children. The function that reads a block in a parameter file is always a member function of the associated object. The relevant function is usually called "readParameters". If an object has children associated with nested subblocks in the parameter file, this function invokes the corresponding member function of each child to read each nested subblock.</p>
<p>Each parameter block begins with a line containing a label, following by an opening curly bracket ("{"). The label is the name of the class of the associated C++ object. No white space may appear between the class name and the opening bracket. For example, the block that initializes the <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSystem.html" title="A System for Molecular Dynamics simulation.">McMd::MdSystem</a> object in the above example begins with the line "MdSystem{". Each block ends with a matched closing bracket (i.e., "}"). The label in the opening line contains the class name, but (for the sake of brevity) does not include the name of the enclosing namespace (e.g., <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a>, <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a>, <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a>, or <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a>). By convention, nested blocks are indented, though indentation and additional white space are actually ignored when the file is parsed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_param_synatx_parameter_section"></a>
Individual Parameters</h2>
<p>Parameter blocks may contain values of any number of individual parameters, in addition to nested subblocks. The value of each parameter that is represented by a built-in C++ variable (e.g., an int, double, bool, or std::string) is given on a single line that contains a label string followed by the parameter value. The label must be a single word, with no white space. The value of each parameter is assigned to a private or protected member variable of the class whose name is given in the first line of the innermost enclosing parameter block. The label for each parameter corresponds to the name of this associated variable. By convention, names of all private and protected class members in Simpatico end with a trailing underscore ("_"). The associated parameter file label is given by the member variable name without the trailing underscore.</p>
<p>For example, the number of atom types in an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSimulation.html" title="A molecular dynamics simulation of a single MdSystem.">McMd::MdSimulation</a> object is given by private member variable named nAtomType_. The value of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSimulation.html" title="A molecular dynamics simulation of a single MdSystem.">McMd::MdSimulation</a> is preceded in the parameter file by a label "nAtomType". This parameter appears within the MdSimulation{...} parameter file block.</p>
<p>The values of some parameters are stored as instances of non-primitive data types, such as enumerations or small classes, that are defined within the Simpatico source code. In these cases, as for primitive C++ variables, the parameter is given on a single line containing a label followed by a text representation of its value. In these cases, however, the text representation of the "value" of each such non-primitive variable must be defined by iostream extractor (&gt;&gt;) and insertor (&lt;&lt;) operators that are defined for that data type. For example, in the above file, the "type" member of the <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1EnergyEnsemble.html" title="A statistical ensemble for energy.">Util::EnergyEnsemble</a> object is an instance of the enumeration <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1EnergyEnsemble.html#a7685d5a360ecfeda650262a9b7c56640" title="Enumeration of the allowed types of EnergyEnsemble.">Util::EnergyEnsemble::Type</a>. This enum can have values ADIABATIC (constant energy) or ISOTHERMAL (constant temperature). The value of this variable is read by an overloaded extractor (&gt;&gt;) operator that recognizes either lower case "adiabatic" or upper case "ADIABATIC" as valid string representations of the ADIABATIC enum value.</p>
<p>Some parameters are also stored internally in one-dimensional (1D) arrays. A 1D array of parameters is given in a parameter file by a sequence of lines in which the first line contains the label (the name of the array variable) and the value of the first element, while subsequent lines contain values of subsequent elements. For example, the atomTypes member of an MdSimulation is an array that contains nAtomType instances of class AtomType. The string representation of an AtomType, which is defined by an extractor (&gt;&gt;) operator, contains a name string ("A" or "B" in this example) followed by a floating point value for the mass. (The mass is 1.0 for both types in the example). The number of elements in such an array must be known before the array is read, and is passed as a parameter to the function that reads an array of parameters. In this case, the number of elements in the atomTypes array is given by the value of "nAtomType", which appears before the "atomTypes" array in the file format. In the example, because nAtomType = 2, the atomTypes array contains two lines.</p>
<p>Variables that are stored internally in two-dimensional arrays or <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1Matrix.html" title="Two-dimensional array container template (abstract).">Util::Matrix</a> objects also use a multi-line parameter file format. In this case, the first line contains a label (the name of the associated 2D array or <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1Matrix.html" title="Two-dimensional array container template (abstract).">Util::Matrix</a> variable), followed by the elements of the first row, with subsequent rows on subsequent lines. In the above example, this format is used for the epsilon, sigma, and cutoff members of an LJPair pair potential object, which are each 2 x 2 matrices in this example. In LJPair, of these parameters is stored internally as a two dimensional C-array, in which epsilon[i][j] is the value of the Lennard-Jones epsilon parameter for interactions between atoms of types i and j, for 0 &lt; i, j &lt;= nAtomType.</p>
<p>The meaning of most parameter labels should be self-explanatory. When they are not, the conventions used in this file format are designed to make it easy for users to look up the meaning of the variable in the html documentation or source code: Each parameter in this file format is labelled by the name of an associated member variable of a class. The relevant class is given by the class name in the first line of the intermost enclosing block. The meaning of every member variable should be adequately explained in the html doxygen class documentation of the class, and is always documented in the header (*.h) file of the enclosing class.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_param_syntax_optional_section"></a>
Optional Parameters</h2>
<p>Each parameter in a parameter file may be either required or optional. The vast majority are required. The entry for a required parameter (the label and value) must appear at a specific position in a file format, or execution will halt. The entry for an optional parameter line may be either present or absent. If an optional parameter is absent from a parameter file, the associated variable is assigned a default value, and the program continues on to the next parameter in the expected file format.</p>
<p>The parameter nBondType in the above example is an optional parameter. This parameter specifies how many distinct types of covalent bond can exist in a simulation. Setting nBondType to 0 de-activates the bond potential. This is the appropriate setting for a simulation of point particles (e.g., liquid Argon). If the line containing the nBondType parameter were missing, nBondType would be set to zero by default, thus de-activating the bond potential. In versions of the program that are compiled with angle and dihedral potentials enabled, the optional nBondType parameter may be followed by optional nAngleType and nDihedralType parameters. Each of these enables the corresponding angle or dihedral potential if it is assigned a nonzero values, and each of these is also set to zero by default. The angle and dihedral potentials are thus disabled if the nAngleType and nDihedralType parameters are absent, as is true in the above example parameter file for a model with no angle or dihedral potential. In versions of the program that are compiled with external potential enabled, the optional parameters nBondType, nAngleType, and nDihedralType are followed by an optional boolean variable named hasExternal, which enables the external potential if it is set to true (1) or disables the external potential when set to false (0), and which is set to false (0) by default.</p>
<p>Implementation: Processing of optional parameters is based on identification of label strings. If a label string that is read from a parameter file does not match the expected label for a required parameter, the program will print out an error message stating what label was expected and what label was found, and then halt execution. If such a label string does not match the expected label for optional parameter, however, the stores the label in a buffer, moves on to the next parameter in the parameter file format, and tries to match the same label against the expected label for the next parameter. If a file format contains two or more optional parameters in a row, execution will continue until the last unmatched label is matched or until it fails to match the expected label for a required parameter or a required closing bracket.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_param_syntax_conditional_section"></a>
Conditional Parameters and Blocks</h2>
<p>Some parameters or blocks in a parameter file may be required only if parameters that have been read previously take on specific values. Generally, the format does not required or allow values of parameters if it is already known that their values would be meaningless or irrelvent on the basis of values of parameters that appear earlier in the parameter file that. For example, the "bondStyle" parameter and the "BondPotential" block parameter are required if and only if nBondType has been assigned a positive value, thus enabling the bond potential. Similarly "angleStyle" and "AnglePotential" would be required immediately after "bondStyle" and "BondPotential", respectively, if and only if nAngleType &gt; 0, while "dihedralStyle" and "DihedralPotential" are required if and only if nDihdedralType &gt; 0.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_param_syntax_polymorphic_section"></a>
Polymorphic Blocks</h2>
<p>Some blocks in a Simpatico parameter file are "polymorphic". The use of polymorphic blocks allows a user to choose at run time which elements of a simulation (e.g., which among several possible integration algorithms, diagnostics, and file formats) should be used in a particular simulation. A polymorphic parameter file block is one that may contain the format appropriate to any of several possible subclasses of a particular base class. The desired subclass is identified by the class name label in the opening line of such a block.</p>
<p>For example, the above mdSim parameter file contains a polymorphic block associated with the molecular dynamics integrator. This block is the last element of the MdSystem block. This block is allowed to contain the file format for any of several possible subclasses of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdIntegrator.html" title="Abstract base for molecular dynamics integrators.">McMd::MdIntegrator</a>, each of which implements a different molecular dynamics integration algorithm. In this example, this block begins with a line labelled "NveVvIntegrator{", which contains the name of a subclass of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdIntegrator.html" title="Abstract base for molecular dynamics integrators.">McMd::MdIntegrator</a> that implements an energy conserving velocity Verlet algorithm. By putting the appropriate format for an NveVvIntegrator at this point in the file, the user has chosen this algorithm from among several alternatives. To instead use an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1NvtNhIntegrator.html" title="A Nose-Hoover NVT molecular dynamics integrator.">McMd::NvtNhIntegrator</a>, which implements an isothermal Nose-Hoover integrator, this block in the parameter file could be changed to contain the file format for an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1NvtNhIntegrator.html" title="A Nose-Hoover NVT molecular dynamics integrator.">McMd::NvtNhIntegrator</a>, which would begin with the line "NvtNhIntegrator{" containing the name of the desired subclass. Different file formats and parameters may be used for different subclasses. For example, the format for an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1NvtNhIntegrator.html" title="A Nose-Hoover NVT molecular dynamics integrator.">McMd::NvtNhIntegrator</a> contains a parameter that controls the strength of the coupling of the system to an auxiliary variable that acts as a heat bath, while no such parameter is needed in an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1NveVvIntegrator.html" title="An NVE Verlet molecular dynamics integrator.">McMd::NveVvIntegrator</a>.</p>
<p>Implementation: To read a polymorphic block associated with a subclass of a base class named "Base", the method of the parent object that parses its parameter file block must: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Read the first line of the sublock, and extract the name of the desired subclass  </li>
<li>
Compare the subclass name to a list of known subclasses of the base class "Base"  </li>
<li>
Create an instance of the desired subclass, which is assigned to a Base* pointer owned by the parent object, or throw an Exception if the class name is not recognized </li>
<li>
Call a virtual method of the new object to read the body of the parameter file block for the new object </li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of the MD integrator, the address of the new integrator object is assigned to an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdIntegrator.html" title="Abstract base for molecular dynamics integrators.">McMd::MdIntegrator</a>* pointer member variable of the parent MdSystem object. The implementation of this algorithm relies on an associated "Factory" class, which is responsible for the recognizing the subclass name and creating a new object (steps 2 and 3). Factory classes are discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="extend_factory_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_param_syntax_manager_section"></a>
Manager Classes</h2>
<p>The above example file contains two blocks labelled "SpeciesManager" and "DiagnosticManager" that are examples of "Manager" classes. The parameter block associated with each Manager class contains a sequence of polymorphic subblocks, separated by spaces. Each such subblock may contain the file format for any known subclass of the associated base class (e.g., any subclass of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Species.html" title="A Species represents a set of chemically similar molecules.">McMd::Species</a> or <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Diagnostic.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">McMd::Diagnostic</a>). A Manager block may contain any number of such blocks, followed by a closing bracket on a line by itself.</p>
<p>A Manager class is used to allow a user to specify an arbitrary number of instances of different subclasses of a particular base class for use in a simulation. Thus for example, the sub-blocks of the SpeciesManager block lists all of the molecular species that may be present in a particular simulation. Each such sublock describes the chemical structure of a different species of molecules, and is represented by an instance of a subclass of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Species.html" title="A Species represents a set of chemically similar molecules.">McMd::Species</a>. The subblocks of the DiagnosticManager block instead list the subclasses of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Diagnostic.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">McMd::Diagnostic</a>, each of which implements a data analysis and/or data output operation that should be invoked periodically during a simulation. The parameter file format for an mcSim Monte Carlo (MC) simulation also has an McMoveManager block that contains subblocks associated with different Markov MC moves that should be chosen at random at each step of a Markov MC simulation.</p>
<p>Internally, a Manager class is a container that holds an array of pointers to dynamically allocated objects that are all instances of (generally) different subclasses of a common base class. Thus, for example, an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1SpeciesManager.html" title="A Manager for a set of Species objects.">McMd::SpeciesManager</a> has an array of Species* pointers to <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Species.html" title="A Species represents a set of chemically similar molecules.">McMd::Species</a> objects that represent different types of molecule. An <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1DiagnosticManager.html" title="Manager for a list of Diagnostic objects.">McMd::DiagnosticManager</a> contains an array of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Diagnostic.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">McMd::Diagnostic</a>* pointers to instances of subclasses of McMd::Diagnostics.</p>

Potential Energy Styles</h2>
<p>In mcSim and mdSim simulations, the <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1McSystem.html" title="A System for use in a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.">McMd::McSystem</a> or <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSystem.html" title="A System for Molecular Dynamics simulation.">McMd::MdSystem</a> object has several associated types of potential energy. In a ddSim simulation, corresponding potential energies objects are members of the main <a class="el" href="classDdMd_1_1Simulation.html" title="Main object for a domain-decomposition MD simulation.">DdMd::Simulation</a> object. The default versions of all three programs implement only a non-bonded pair potential and a bond potential. Other types of potential energy, such as 3-body bond angle and 4-body dihedral potentials or an external one-bondy potential, may be enabled by defining associated macros (e.g., INTER_ANGLE, INTER_DIHEDRAL, and/or INTER_EXTERNAL) in the file inter/defines.mk, and then recompiling.</p>
<p>At run time, a user may choose from among several functional forms for each type of potential energy by specifying a "style" parameter string. For example, the type of nonbonded pair potential function is specified by the value of the string "pairStyle". This can take on values such as "LJPair", corresponding to a Lennard-Jones potential, or "DpdPair", corresponding to the soft potential typically used in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations. Each of the allowed values of this pair style string corresponds to the name of class defined in the src/inter/pair directory. Similarly, "bondStyle" can take on values such as "HarmonicBond" or "FeneBond", which are the names of classes defined in the directory src/inter/bond. The classes that represent particular potential energy functions are referred to in what follows as "interaction" classes, and are all defined within the "Inter" namespace. In the above example, the "pairStyle" and "bondStyle" parameters appear near the top of the MdSystem block. The parameter file format for a code compiled with angle and dihedral potentials enabled would also contain "angleStyle" and "dihedralStyle" strings to specify choices of angle and dihedral interaction classes. These "style" variables are followed by a set of blocks that contain the parameters for different types of potential energy (pair, bond, etc.). In the above example, these blocks are labelled "MdPairPotential" and "BondPotential". Each of these blocks contains the set of parameters required by the potential energy function specified by the corresponding "style" variable, which are different for different interaction styles. The parameter file blocks for pair potential classes contain parameters that are required to set up a cell list and/or a Verlet pair list, as discussed in more detail in subsequent pages.</p>

How a parameter file is parsed</h2>
<p>To use this file format effectively, and diagnose errors, it is useful for users to understand how it is parsed. As already noted, each block in a parameter file is associated with an object that is an instance of a class whose class name is given explicitly in the first line of the block. Each such class must be a subclass of <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1ParamComposite.html" title="An object that can read multiple parameters from file.">Util::ParamComposite</a> and (with a few exceptions) must provide an implementation of the virtual method <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1ParamComposite.html#a172a3a656b5829c8d758424ad09a22a6" title="Read body of parameter block, without opening and closing lines.">Util::ParamComposite::readParameters(std::istream&amp;)</a>, which reads the body of the associated parameter file block. The implementation of the readParameters() functions defines the order in which individual parameters and nested sub-blocks must appear within the body of the associated parameter file block. An explanation of the programming conventions used in all readParameters() methods is given <a class="el" href="developer_param_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The most reliable documentation of the file format for each parameter block is thus provided by the source code of the the readParameters() method of the associated class. When an examination of available html documentation and error messages is not enough to explain the required format, users can read the source code of the "readParameters" method of the associated class. An html copy of the implementation of any function of any class can be found using the "Classes" link at the top of any page of this html documentation, open the doxygen class documentation, and clicking on the short function description to get the long function description, and then clicking on a link within the long description to open an html version of the function source code.</p>
