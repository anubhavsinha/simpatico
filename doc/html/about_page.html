<h1>About Simpatico </h1>  </div>
</div>
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>Simpatico is a library of C++ classes and programs for Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of molecular and polymer liquids. It contains the following main programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a single processor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A program for parallel MD simulations, using a domain decomposition algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The single-processor MC and MD programs are named mcSim and mdSim, respectively. These program can also execute multi-processor replica exchange simulations in which processor simulates a different system. The parallel domain decomposition MD program is called ddSim. ddSim is a recent addition to the package, and is less mature than mcSim or mdSim. Simpatico is distributed under the terms of the GNU public license (see the LICENSE file).</p>
<p>The design of Simpatico was motivated by the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensibility: New algorithms may be added for most elements of a simulation via C++ inheritance, without modifying the core source code. Extensible elements of a simulation include: Monte Carlo moves, molecular dynamics integrators, potential energy functions, molecular species, data analysis algorithms, and configuration file formats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency: Simpatico is designed to be competitive as a tool for computationally demanding research projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Integration of Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics: The single processor mcSim and mdSim programs use similar data structures to provide efficient implementations of both MC and MD algorithms, as well as a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm in which short MD simulations are used as proposed Monte Carlo moves. Simpatico also provides an module that allows the HOOMD-blue code for MD on graphical processing units (GPUs) to be used as an engine for very fast hybrid MC simulations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Integration of data analysis: mcSim and mdSim come bundled with a set of data analysis classes that can be used either "on-the-fly", during a simulation, or by using the same two programs for post-processing of trajectory files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The design of mcSim and mdSim (which share a great deal of code) is similar in many ways to that of <a href="http://www.etomica.org">Etomica</a>, which was written in Java by David Kofke's group at the University of Buffalo. The domain decomposition algorithm used in ddSim is similar to that originally introduced in the <a href="http://www.lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMMPS</a> molecular dynamics code.</p>
<p>Simpatico is a relatively young project, and lacks some features found in more mature molecular dynamics packages, such as Lammps, NAMD, Gromacs, and Espresso, and in a smaller number of MC packages, such as Towhee. It has thus far been used only for simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring models of polymer liquids.</p>
