</p>
<p>Simpatico is distributed only as source code, and must be compiled by the user. All source code is written in ANSI 1998 standard C++. It has been developed and tested using the gcc and intel compilers in a linux environment, and with the gcc compiler in Mac OS X. It should compile with any modern, standard compliant C++ compiler.</p>
<p>The single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim have no external dependencies. A Message Passing Interface (MPI) library is required to compile the ddSim parallel MD program. An MPI library is also required to create multiprocessor versions of mcSim and mdSim, for parallel simulations in which different systems run on different processors.</p>
<p>The build system uses unix makefiles, and was developed using the gnu version of make (gmake).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_getcode_section"></a>
Getting the source code</h2>
<p>The source code for simpatico is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, as project dmorse/simpatico. The source files may be obtained either by downloading a tar file from the (very simple) <a href="http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html">home page</a> or by using a git client to clone the public <a href="https://github.com/dmorse/simpatico">git repository</a>.</p>
<p>To clone the git repository, after installing a git client on your home machine, cd to the directory you wish to contain the simpatico root directory, and enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; git clone git:<span class="comment">//github.com/dmorse/simpatico.git</span>
</pre></div><p> This should create a copy of the repository in a new subdirectory of the working directory, which will be named simpatico.</p>
<p>To extract the code from a tar file that was downloaded from the home page, move the tar file to the directory that should contain the simpatico root directory, and then enter "tar -xvf filename" from this directory, where "filename" denotes the name of the gzipped tar file. This will create a subdirectory named dmorse-simpatico-ID/, where "ID" represents a hexadecimal identifier for the most recent commit in the git repository. We recommend that you immediately rename this directory "simpatico/", which is the name of the corresponding directory in the repository.</p>
<p>Throughout this documentation, we assume that the root project directory is named simpatico/. References to paths that do not start explicitly with "simpatico/" should be understood to be relative paths, relative to this root directory. The directory structure is explained <a class="el" href="source_directory_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_short_section"></a>
Short instructions</h2>
<p>Here is a brief summary of instructions for compiling all of the simpatico programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add simpatico/bin to the users PATH, and add simpatico/tools/python to PYTHONPATH</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>cd simpatico/ (i.e., to the simpatico root directory)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>./setup</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make mcMd</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Check MPI settings and paths in build/parall/compiler.mk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make ddMd</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make mcMd-mpi</li>
</ul>
<p>The setup script and all three "make" commands must be executed from the simpatico root directory. The command "make mcMd" builds the single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim. The command "make ddMd" builds ddSim, and "make mcMd-mpi" builds multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim.</p>
<p>Each of the above steps is discussed in more detail below.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_environment_section"></a>
Set environment variables</h2>
<p>Before compiling any code, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add simpatico/bin to the PATH shell environment variable (the shell command search path)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add simpatico/tools/python to the PYTHONPATH environment variable (the python module search path)</li>
</ul>
<p>To do this, you must add some variant of the following lines to your the .profile or .bash_profile file in your home directory: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">SIMPATICO_DIR=${HOME}/simpatico
export PATH=${PATH}:/${SIMPATICO_DIR}/bin
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/${SIMPATICO_DIR}/tools/python
</pre></div><p> The value of SIMPATICO_DIR should be set to the path to the simpatico root directory. As an example, this is taken here to be a subdirectory of the home directory. After adding an appropriate variant of these lines to .profile or .bash_profile, log out, log back in, and then enter "echo $PATH" and "echo $PYTHONPATH" to make sure that these variables have been set correctly.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The simpatico/bin directory is the default location of all executable files. It must be added to the users PATH to allow the operating system to find the executables.</p>
<p>The simpatico/tools/python directory must be in the PYTHONPATH to allow the build system to generate information about dependencies among C++ files during compilation. The system used by simpatico to generate information about inter-file dependencies uses a python module that is located in this directory.</p>
<p>Automatic dependency generation:</p>
<p>Automatic generation of dependency information during compilation is enabled by default, but can be disabled without preventing the code from compiling. This feature is really needed only by users who plan to modify or extend the source code. If you run into trouble during compilation and suspect that a python script is causing trouble, you can try disabling dependency generation by entering </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; ./configure -k0
</pre></div><p> from the simpatico/ root directory. We recommend trying to compile with dependency generation enabled (the default), and to try disabling it only if you run into trouble that you suspect is related python module access. Automatic dependency generation is discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_compile_page.html#compile_dependency_section">below</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_setup_section"></a>
Run the setup script</h2>
<p>After obtaining the source code, but before attempting to compile any files, you must run a bash script named "setup". This script is located in the root simpatico/ directory, and must be executed from within this directory. Thus, starting from the directory that contain the simpatico/ root directory, you would enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; cd simpatico
&gt; ./setup
</pre></div><p> The period and backslash in "./setup" are required to specify the location of the script (in the current directory).</p>
<p>Purpose: The setup script creates initial user versions of several makefile fragments and C++ files that are required for compilation, but that users may need to modify. The identity and content of these configuration files is discussed below (<a class="el" href="user_compile_page.html#compile_makefile_section">User-modifiable make files</a>). The setup script should only need to be invoked once, before you attempt to compile any compile any source code. After running the setup script, further changes to the system configuration can be made using a separate "configure" script, as discussed <a class="el" href="user_compile_page.html#compile_configure_section">below</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_build_directories_section"></a>
Build Directories</h2>
<p>The simpatico build system can execute either in-source build, in which the object files created by the compiler are written in the src/ directory tree, alongside the corresponding source files, or an out-of-source build, in which the object files are placed in a separate directory tree.</p>
<p>Invoking make commands from the simpatico root directory, as described above, executes an out-of-source build. In this case, object files for different programs are placed to two separate build directories, outside the source tree. Object files that are created during compilation of the serial mcSim and mdSim programs, which do not require an MPI library, are placed in the directory tree rooted at simpatico/build/serial/. Object files that are created during compilation of ddSim, and of the multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim, are instead placed in the directory tree rooted at simpatico/build/parallel. Two different build directories are used different programs use different of common source files, depending on whether or not MPI is enabled at compile time.</p>
<p>An in-source build may be executed by invoking make from the simpatico/src directory, rather than from the root directory, using the same makefile target names as those used in the root directory (i.e., "make mcMd", "make ddMd", etc.) As a convenience for developers, invoking "make all" from any subdirectory of the src/ tree will execute an in-source compilation of all of the source files in the directory tree rooted at that subdirectory.</p>
<p>After the setup script is run, both build directories (build/serial and build/parallel) and the src/ directories each contain a file named compiler.mk. These files makefile fragments that are created by the setup script. After running the setup script, inspect these files. In each of them, the value of the makefile variable ROOT_DIR should be set to the absolute path to the simpatico/ root directory on your machine. (If this variable is not set correctly, nothing else will work). If you move the simpatico/ root directory after running "setup", you will need to either manually edit this variable in all of these files, or rerun the setup script.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_mcMd_section"></a>
Compile mcSim and mdSim</h2>
<p>As a first step, we recommend compiling the single-processor versions of the mcSim and mdSim programs, using the default gcc compiler with a default set of features enabled. To do this, after running the setup script (see above), simply enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; make mcMd
</pre></div><p> from the root simpatico/ directory. This command should create executables named mcSim and mdSim for MC and MD simulations that (by default) are installed in the simpatico/bin directory.</p>
<p>The "make mcMd" command will: (1) compile all of the *.cpp source files in the src/util, src/inter, and src/mcMd directories, (2) create three corresponding static library files, and (3) compile and link the main programs src/mcMd/mcSimp.cpp and <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp</a> to create the executables. If make is invoked from the root directory, the resulting object files, *.d dependency files, and static libraries should be placed in the build/serial directory tree, which has the same structure as the src/ directory.</p>
<p>To remove all of the object files, libraries, and executable files created by "make mcMd", cd to the build/serial directory and enter "make clean" from there.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_configure_section"></a>
Choosing optional features</h2>
<p>The above instructions should compile default versions of mcSim and mdSim, using the gnu g++ compiler as a default compiler. The build/serial, build/parallel, src/ directories each contain both a file named compiler.mk and a bash script named "configure". The configure script can be used to change the choice of compiler and/or the choice of some optional features. "Optional  features" are features of the code can be enabled or disabled at compile time by conditional compilation, by using the build system to define or undefine C++ preprocessor macro variables. The "compiler.mk" file and "configure" script in each of these directories control the compiler options and features only for code that is built in that build directory. The configure script must be run from the build directory that contains it. The configure script in each build directory works by editing makefile fragments that are also placed in subdirectories of the build directory. These makefile fragments can also be edited manually.</p>
<p>As an introduction to the ./configure script, cd to the build/serial directory, and enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; ./configure -q
</pre></div><p> Invoking the configure script with the -q option prints a list of which features are currently enabled, and what compiler is being used. Immediately after running the setup script, it should produce an output that looks like this: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">-m OFF - MPI
-g OFF - debugging
-a ON  - bond potential
-a OFF - angle potential
-d OFF - dihedral potential
-e OFF - external potential
-l OFF - links (<span class="keyword">mutable</span> bonds)
-s OFF - shift
-k ON  - automatic dependency tracking
COMPILER:=gcc
</pre></div><p> Every line except the last shows whether an optional feature is currently enabled (ON) or disabled (OFF). The last line gives an identifier for the current compiler (gcc, by default). The output of the configure script in the build/parallel directory should look similiar, except that it should indicate that MPI is ON (enabled).</p>
<p>Each line in this output that is associated with an optional feature begins with the command line option (a dash followed by a letter) that can be used to enable or disable that feature. For example, debugging is enanbled or disabled using the "-g" option of the configure script. A feature is enabled by invoking configure using the associated option followed by "1", or disabled by invoking the option followed by a "0". Thus, for example, to enable debugging (and thus run more exhaustive logic and data consistency checks during execution), you would enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; ./configure -g1
</pre></div><p> from the appropriate build directory. To disable debugging, you would instead enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; ./configure -g0
</pre></div><p> All available optional features are discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_options_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever a non-default feature is enabled, the simpatico build system adds a corresponding suffix to the name of all effected executables. For example, the executable file for a version of mcSim compiled with debugging enabled, but no other optional features, would be called mcSim_g, using a suffix "_g" to indicate that debugging is enabled. This is intended to make it easier to manage several different versions of each program, with different features enabled, though it does require the user to understand the association between file name suffixes and features. We recommend that you read the page <a class="el" href="user_options_page.html">2.11 Compile Time Options</a> before enabling optional features other than MPI (which is discussed explicitly below), and then look at the simpatico/bin directory after compiling to see the names of the resulting executable files.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_compiler_section"></a>
Choosing a compiler or compiler options</h2>
<p>By default, the build system uses the gnu compiler collection (gcc) g++ compiler. It is also possible to choose a different compiler, and to change the options passed to the compiler.</p>
<p>The file src/compiler.mk defines a string variable COMPILER. This variable holds a label for a compiler. The default value, COMPILER=gcc, selects the gnu compiler. The default version of the file src/compiler.mk also contains settings for the intel compiler, which may be selected by setting COMPILER=intel.</p>
<p>The -c option of the configure script may be used to reset the value of the COMPILER string. This option takes the desired value of the COMPILER string as an argument. To choose the intel compiler for both serial and parallel programs, rather than gcc, one would thus enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; ./configure -h intel
</pre></div><p> once in each build directory (i.e., from build/serial and build/parallel) before compiling.</p>
<p>Other required changes to compiler options or to paths for libraries and header files can be modified by manually editing the compiler.mk file in each build directory. The setup script creates an initial version of this file in each build directory and in the src/ directory by making a copying of a file named src/compiler.mk_r in the same directory. Each compiler.mk_r file contains the default version that is stored in the git repository. As a user, you may thus modify the file src/compiler.mk as needed, but should avoid modifying src/compiler.mk_r.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_mpi_section"></a>
Enable MPI</h2>
<p>The ddSim program and the multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim all require an MPI library for interprocessor communication. MPI is enabled in a specific build directory when the variable UTIL_MPI is defined and set equal 1 in the compiler.mk file in that directory.. Before attempting to compile these multi-processor programs, users should inspect the makefile variables in the file build/parallel/compiler.mk that specify the options passed to the compiler.</p>
<p>The variable MPI_LIB in each src/compiler.mk file is an identifier that can be used to choose from among different sets of compiler settings that correspond to different MPI library implementations. The values of the variables COMPILER and MPI_LIB thus select a block of compiler options appropriate for a specific combination of compiler and MPI implementation.</p>
<p>The default value of MPI_LIB for both the gcc and intel compiler is MPI_LIB=mpicxx. This value selects settings designed for use with systems that use linux kernel modules to manage a users environment, and in which the C++ compiler is invoked indirectly via a wrapper script named "mpicxx". The modules system allows a user to select a compiler and mpi library loading appropriate modules before compiling any code. The wrapper script "mpicxx" then invokes the selected combination of compiler and mpi library. This system is used on all of the machines of the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute that were used for development. When using modules, one must make sure that the choice of compiler in the compiler.mk file is consistent with that chosen by loading linux modules.</p>
<p>Setting COMPILER=gcc and MPI_LIB=openmpi instead selects a set of compiler options that we used to compile simpatico on a multi-core Mac laptop, using a copy of the &lt;a <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org">http://www.open-mpi.org</a>&gt;openmpi library that was compiled from source.</p>
<p>If you are using a system that does not use modules, and the settings provided for gcc with openmpi do not work, you may have to edit the CXXFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS variables to reflect the locations of the header and library files for the MPI library on your machine. If you have not compiled an MPI program on a particular machine, you may need to either do a bit of searching to identify the appropriate paths or ask for help from a local guru.</p>
<p>During compilation, MPI is enabled only if the the makefile variable UTIL_MPI is defined in the relevant compiler.mk file. This variable is set automatically by the ddMd and mcmd-mpi makefile targets that compile programs that require MPI, so users should not need to set it explicitly.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_ddMd_section"></a>
Compile ddSim</h2>
<p>To compile the ddSim parallel MD program, after checking the compiler settings and paths for MPI (as discussed above), simply enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; make ddMd
</pre></div><p> from the simpatico root directory. If successful, the command "make ddMd" will place MPI-enabled versions of object files in the build/parallel directory, and install an executable named ddSim in the simpatico/bin directory.</p>
<p>To clean up object (*.o), dependency (*.d), and library files created by building ddSim, cd to the build directory (build/parallel for an out-of-source build), and enter "make clean". This does not remove the executable file.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_multi_section"></a>
Compile mcSim and mdSim (multi-processor versions)</h2>
<p>Multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim can be used to run:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple completely independent simulations as an MPI job, with separate parameter files</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Multiple simulations with a sequence of parameter values specified in a single parameter file</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Replica exchange simulations</li>
</ul>
<p>To compile multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim, if automatic dependency generation is enabled (the default), simply enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; make mcMd-mpi
</pre></div><p> from the simpatico root directory. This should place executable files named mcSim_m and mdSim_m in the simpatico/bin directory. The suffix "_m" on these executable names is used to distinguish multi-processor and the single processor versions of mcSim and mdSim.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_doc_section"></a>
Generating html documentation</h2>
<p>The html documentation you are reading was generated using the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen </a> documentation utility. Neither the git repository nor the downoadable version of the source codecontain a copy of the html documentation files. If desired, you may use doxygen to generate a local copy of the web documentation. If dOxygen is installed on your machine, you can regenerate all of the html documentation by entering </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; make html 
</pre></div><p> from the simpatico root directory. The resulting html documentation is deposited in the doc/html/ directory.</p>
<p>To begin reading the main page of the documentation, open the file simpatico/doc/html/index.html in any web browser, e.g., by entering "firefox doc/html/index.html" on linux or "open doc/html/index.html" on a Mac.</p>
<p>The text of the page you are reading now, along with others that are not extracted from C++ files, is in a set of files in the doc/dox directory. These are written in plain text, and can also be read with any text editor. Documentation for each C++ class is extracted by doxygen from documentation blocks in the class header file.</p>
<p>To remove all the html documentation in the doc/html directory, enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; make clean-html
</pre></div><p> from the root directory.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_makefile_section"></a>
User-modifiable make files</h2>
<p>Simpatico uses a system of unix makefiles to control the build process. The ./setup script creates copies of several makefile fragments that are included in other makefiles, and that users may need to modify. The build/serial, build/parallel, and src/ directories each contain the following modifiable makefile fragments, given here as paths relative to the root of the build directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>compiler.mk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>util/defines.mk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>inter/defines.mk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>mcMd/defines.mk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ddMd/defines.mk</li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of these file files determine the choice of compiler options and optional features used to compile the code that is built ina specific build directory. The contents of these files in the src/ directory effect only the result of in-source builds, which is done by invoking make commands from within the src directory. None of these makefile fragments files are in the git repository. Initial versions of each of these files are instead created by the setup script by making copies of default repository versions of each file. The repository version of each such file is a file with the same name as the user configuration file, with a file extension *.mk_r rather than *.mk.</p>
<p>The most common modifications of these files can be carried out using the configure script in the same build directory, but some changes require manual editing. Users may modify these *.mk files as needed, but should generally avoid modifying the corresonding "*.mk_r" repository versions.</p>
<p>The file src/compiler.mk defines makefile variables that specify the choice of C++ compiler, MPI library, and compiler options. It defines variables ROOT_DIR, SRC_DIR, OBJ_DIR and BIN_DIR that represent paths to the simpatico root directory, the source directory, the build directory, and the directory in which executables should be placed. It also contains a definition of a variable MAKEDEP that (if not commented out) enables automatic dependency generation, and a variable UTIL_MPI that (if not commented out) enables MPI.</p>
<p>The makefile fragments src/util/defines.mk, src/inter/defines.mk, mcMd/defines.mk, and ddMd/defines.mk contain definitions of makefile variables that enable or disable various optional compile time features. These definitions can be commented out or uncommented using the configure script. All available option features are discussed <a class="el" href="user_options_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_source_section"></a>
User-modifiable C++ source files</h2>
<p>The setup script also creates initial default versions of several C++ source files that users may need to modify in order to extend the functionality of Simpatico, e.g., by adding a new class that implements a new analysis or simulation algorithm. Each of these files is a file with a file extension *.cpp that is initially created by copying a repository version of the file, which is a file with the same base name but a file extension .cpp_r. See the body of the setup script (which is a simple shell script) to see which source files are created by this method.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Because the setup script creates some files that users may subsequently modify, users should be careful to NOT call the setup script again after modifying any of these makefile fragments or C++ files, unless the user intends to discard all modifications of these files and overwrite the modified versions of these files with copies of the default version.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="compile_dependency_section"></a>
Automatic dependency generation</h2>
<p>When automatic dependency generation is enabled (the default), the build system generates a "dependency" file, with a suffix *.d, whenever it compiles *.cpp source file. Each dependency file lists all of the files upon which the resulting *.o object file depends. This list includes the source file an all header files that are included directly or indirectly into the source file. Each dependency file is placed in the same directory within a build directory as the corresponding *.o object.</p>
<p>Automatic dependency generation may be disabled entering "./configure -k0" from the root directory. Automatic dependency generation is not strictly necessary for users who want to compile the code as is, without modifying or adding any C++ files. It is essential, however, for developers, because it allows the build system to keep track of what files do or do not need to be recompiled when any file is modified.</p>
<p>If dependency generation is disabled, the only safe way to recompile the code after changing any C++ file or makefile is to do a clean rebuild, by entering "make clean" from the root directory or the relevant build directory before recompiling.</p>
<p>The system for automatic dependency generation uses both the g++ compiler (which does actual analysis of dependencies) and several python scripts. To function, the system requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>A g++ compiler (or a link with this name)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A python interpreter</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The simpatico/tools/python/ directory must be in the PYTHONPATH environment variable</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The makefile variable MAKEDEP must be defined in the relevant src/compiler.mk file</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the g++ compiler is used for dependency analysis even if another compiler (e.g., the intel C++ compiler) is used to actually compile the code.</p>
<p>Automatic dependency generation works by applying the script bin/makeDep to each *.cpp source file whenever that file is compiled. This behavior is dictated by the pattern rules defined in the patterns.mk files in the src/util/, src/inter/, src/mcMd/, and src/ddMd/ directories. Whenever a *.cpp file is compiled, the makeDep script generates a corresponding *.d file with the same base name. Each *.d dependency file defines a makefile rule for the corresponding *.o file target. This rule contains a list of dependencies that includes all of the header files that this source file directly or indirectly includes. The dependency list for each object file also contains all makefile fragments that define preprocessor macros that can effect conditional compilation.</p>
