</p>
<p>Simpatico is distributed only as source code, and must be compiled by the user. All source code is written in ANSI 1998 standard C++. It has been developed and tested using the gcc and intel compilers in a linux environment, and with the gcc compiler in Mac OS X. It should compile with any modern, standard compliant C++ compiler.</p>
<p>The single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim have no external dependencies. A Message Passing Interface (MPI) library is required to compile the ddSim parallel MD program. An MPI library is also required to create multiprocessor versions of mcSim and mdSim, for parallel simulations in which different systems run on different processors.</p>
<p>The build system uses unix makefiles, and was developed using the gnu version of make (gmake).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_getcode_section"></a>
Getting the Source Code</h1>
<p>The source code for simpatico is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, as project dmorse/simpatico. The source files may be obtained either by downloading a tar file from the (very simple) <a href="http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html">home page</a> or by using a git client to clone the public <a href="https://github.com/dmorse/simpatico">git repository</a>.</p>
<p>To clone the git repository, after installing a git client on your home machine, cd to the directory you wish to contain the simpatico root directory, and enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; git clone git:<span class="comment">//github.com/dmorse/simpatico.git</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This should create a copy of the repository in a new subdirectory of the working directory, which will be named simpatico.</p>
<p>To extract the code from a tar file that was downloaded from the home page, move the tar file to the directory that should contain the simpatico root directory, and then enter "tar -xvf filename" from this directory, where "filename" denotes the name of the gzipped tar file. This will create a subdirectory named dmorse-simpatico-ID/, where "ID" represents a hexadecimal identifier for the most recent commit in the git repository. We recommend that you immediately rename this directory "simpatico/", which is the name of the corresponding directory in the repository.</p>
<p>Throughout this documentation, we assume that the root project directory is named simpatico/. References to paths that do not start explicitly with "simpatico/" should be understood to be relative paths, relative to this root directory. The directory structure is explained <a class="el" href="source_directory_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_short_section"></a>
Short Instructions</h1>
<p>Here is a brief summary of instructions for compiling all of the simpatico programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add simpatico/bin to the users PATH, and add simpatico/tools/python to PYTHONPATH</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>cd simpatico/ (i.e., to the simpatico root directory)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>./setup</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make mcMd</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Check MPI settings and paths in src/compiler.mk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make ddMd</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make mcMd-mpi</li>
</ul>
<p>The setup script and all three "make" commands must be executed from the simpatico root directory. The command "make mcMd" builds the single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim, "make ddMd" builds ddSim, and "make mcMd-mpi" builds multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim. Each of the above steps is discussed in more detail below.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_environment_section"></a>
Setting environment variables</h1>
<p>Before compiling any code, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add simpatico/bin to the PATH shell environment variable (the shell command search path)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add simpatico/tools/python to the PYTHONPATH environment variable (the python module search path)</li>
</ul>
<p>To do this, you must add some variant of the following lines to your the .profile or .bash_profile file in your home directory: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">SIMPATICO_DIR=${HOME}/simpatico</div>
<div class="line">export PATH=${PATH}:/${SIMPATICO_DIR}/bin</div>
<div class="line">export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/${SIMPATICO_DIR}/tools/python</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The value of SIMPATICO_DIR should be set to the path to the simpatico root directory. As an example, this is taken here to be a subdirectory of the home directory. After adding an appropriate variant of these lines to .profile or .bash_profile, log out, log back in, and then enter "echo $PATH" and "echo $PYTHONPATH" to make sure that these variables have been set correctly.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The simpatico/bin directory is the default location of all executable files. It must be added to the users PATH to allow the operating system to find the executables.</p>
<p>The simpatico/tools/python directory must be in the PYTHONPATH to allow the build system to generate information about dependencies among C++ files during compilation, which requires a python module from this directory. Automatic generation of dependency information is enabled by default, but can be disabled without preventing the code from compiling. It is really necessary only users who plan to modify or extend the source code. If you run into trouble during compilation and suspect that a python script is causing trouble, you can try disabling dependency generation by entering </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./configure -k0</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the simpatico/ root directory. We recommend trying to compile with dependency generation enabled (the default), and to try disabling it only if you run into trouble. Automatic dependency generation is discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_compile_page.html#compile_dependency_section">below</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_setup_section"></a>
Setup script</h1>
<p>After obtaining the source code, but before attempting to compile any files, you must run a bash script named "setup". This script is located in the root simpatico/ directory, and must be executed from within this directory. Thus, starting from the directory that contain the simpatico/ root directory, you would enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; cd simpatico</div>
<div class="line">&gt; ./setup</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The period and backslash in "./setup" are required to specify the location of the script (in the current directory).</p>
<p>Purpose: The setup script creates initial versions of several makefile fragments and C++ files that are required for compilation, but that users may need to modify. The identity and content of these configuration files is discussed below (<a class="el" href="user_compile_page.html#compile_config_section">Configuration Files</a>). The setup script should only need to be invoked once, before you attempt to compile any compile any source code. After running the setup script, further changes to the system configuration can be made using a separate "configure" script, as discussed <a class="el" href="user_compile_page.html#compile_configure_section">below</a>.</p>
<p>After running the setup script, inspect the file src/compiler.mk. This is a makefile fragment that is created by the setup script. The value of the makefile variable ROOT_DIR should be set to the absolute path to the simpatico/ root directory on your machine. (If this variable is not set correctly, nothing else will work). If you move the simpatico/ root directory after running "setup", you will need to either manually edit this makefile variable, or rerun the setup script.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_mcMd_section"></a>
Compiling mcSim and mdSim</h1>
<p>To compile single-processor versions of the mcSim and mdSim programs, using the default gcc compiler, with a default set of features enabled, you must first run the setup script (see above), and then enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make mcMd</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the root simpatico/ directory. This command should create executables named mcSim and mdSim for MC and MD simulations that (by default) are installed in the simpatico/bin directory.</p>
<p>The "make mcMd" command will: (1) Compiles all of the *.cpp source files in the src/util, src/inter, and src/mcMd directories, (2) create three corresponding static library files, and (3) compile and link the main programs src/mcMd/mcSimp.cpp and <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp</a> to create the executables. All source code is compiled in the source tree: Each *.o object file is placed in the same directory as the corresponding *.cpp source file. The build process creates three static library (*.a) files named libutil.a, libinter.a and libmcmd.a, which (by default) are installed in the simpatico/lib/ directory. These libraries contain objects from the util/, inter/, and mcMd/ subdirectories of the src/ directory, respectively.</p>
<p>Users may change the locations in which the executable and library files are placed by changing the values of the BIN_DIR or LIB_DIR makefile variables in the file src/compiler.mk. Executables files are placed in the directory given by the value of the makefile variable BIN_DIR, which is set to /bin by default. Libraries are placed in the directory given by the variable LIB_DIR, which is set to /lib by default. The names of the MC and MD single-processor executables (mcSim and mdSim, by default) are given by the values of the variables MCSIM_EXE and MDSIM_EXE defined in src/mcMd/defines.mk. The executable files may also be renamed or moved after they are created.</p>
<p>To make the executables accessible from the command line (without requiring that users invoke by typing an absolute path), users should either add the directory that contains these files to their unix PATH environment variable, or install all executable files in a directory that is already in their PATH.</p>
<p>To remove all of the object files, libraries, and executable files created by "make mcMd", one must enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make clean-mcMd</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the root directory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_configure_section"></a>
Configure script</h1>
<p>The above instructions should compile default versions of mcSim and mdSim, using the gnu g++ compiler as a default compiler. The root directory contains a bash script named "configure" that can be used to change the choice of compiler and/or the choice of optional features. "Optional features" are features of the code that can be enabled or disabled at compile time by conditional compilation, by using the build system to define or undefine C++ preprocessor macro variables. Unlike the setup script, the configure script can be run repeatedly to create different versions of each program, with different features enabled. Like the setup script, the configure script must be run from the root simpatico/ directory. The configure script works by editing makefile fragments that are created by the setup script. These makefile fragments can also be edited manually.</p>
<p>As an introduction to the ./configure script, cd to the root directory, and enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./configure -q</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Invoking the configure script with the -q option prints a list of which features are currently enabled, and what compiler is being used. Immediately after running the setup script, it should produce an output that looks like this: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">-m OFF - MPI</div>
<div class="line">-g OFF - debugging</div>
<div class="line">-a OFF - angle potential</div>
<div class="line">-d OFF - dihedral potential</div>
<div class="line">-e OFF - external potential</div>
<div class="line">-l OFF - links (<span class="keyword">mutable</span> bonds)</div>
<div class="line">-k ON  - automatic dependency tracking</div>
<div class="line">COMPILER:=gcc</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Every line except the last shows whether an optional feature is currently enabled (ON) or disabled (OFF). The last line gives an identifier for the current compiler (gcc, by default).</p>
<p>Each line in this output that is associated with an optional feature begins with the command line option (a dash followed by a letter) that can be used to enable or disable that feature. For example, debugging is enanbled or disabled using the "-g" option of the configure script. A feature is enabled by invoking configure using the associated option followed by "1", or disabled by invoking the option followed by a "0". Thus, for example, to enable debugging (and thus run more exhaustive logic and data consistency checks during execution), you would enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./configure -g1</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> To disable debugging, you would enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./configure -g0</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> All available optional features are discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_options_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever a non-default feature is enabled, the simpatico build system adds a corresponding suffix to the name of all effected executables. For example, the executable file for a version of mcSim compiled with debugging enabled, but no other optional features, would be called mcSim_g, using a suffix "_g" to indicate that debugging is enabled. This allows user to manage several different versions of a program, with different features enabled, but requires the user to understand the association between file name suffixes and features. We thus recommend that you read the page <a class="el" href="user_options_page.html">2.11 Compile Time Options</a> before enabling optional features other than MPI (which is discussed explicitly below).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_compiler_section"></a>
Choosing a compiler or compiler options</h1>
<p>By default, the build system uses the gnu compiler collection (gcc) g++ compiler. It is also possible to choose a different compiler, and to change the options passed to the compiler.</p>
<p>The file src/compiler.mk defines a string variable COMPILER. This variable holds a label for a compiler. The default value, COMPILER=gcc, selects the gnu compiler. The repository version of the file src/compiler.mk also contains settings for the intel compiler, which may be selected by setting COMPILER=intel.</p>
<p>The -c option of the configure script may be used to reset the value of the COMPILER string. This option takes the desired value of the COMPILER string as an argument. To choose the intel compiler, rather than gcc, one would thus enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./configure -c intel</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the root directory before compiling.</p>
<p>The file src/compiler.mk file can be modified by the user as needed. The setup script creates an initial version of this file is created by copying a file named src/compiler.mk_r, which contains a default version that is stored in the git repository. As a user, you may thus modify src/compiler.mk as needed, but should avoid modifying src/compiler.mk_r.</p>
<p>Users may also modify the options passed to particular compilers (e.g., gcc or intel) by modifying makefile macros such CXXFLAGS that are also defined in src/compiler.mk. Users may also modify src/compiler.mk to allow compilation with other compilers.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_mpi_section"></a>
Enabling MPI</h1>
<p>The ddSim program and the multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim all require an MPI library for interprocessor communication. MPI is enabled only when the variable UTIL_MPI is defined and set equal 1. Before attemting to compile these multi-processor programs, users should inspect the makefile variables in the file src/compiler.mk that specify the options passed to the compiler.</p>
<p>The variable MPI_LIB in the src/compiler.mk is an identifier that can be used to choose from among different sets of compiler settings for each choice of compiler, to allow compilation with different MPI library implementations. The values of the variables COMPILER and MPI_LIB thus select a block of compiler options appropriate for a particular combination of compiler and MPI implementation.</p>
<p>The default value of MPI_LIB for both the gcc and intel compiler is MPI_LIB=mpicxx. This value selects settings designed for use with systems that use linux kernel modules to manage a users environment, and in which the C++ compiler is invoked indirectly via a wrapper script named "mpicxx". The modules system allows a user to select a compiler and mpi library loading appropriate modules before compiling any code. The wrapper script "mpicxx" then invokes the selected combination of compiler and mpi library. This system is used on all of the machines of the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute that were used for development.</p>
<p>Setting COMPILER=gcc and MPI_LIB=openmpi instead selects a set of compiler options that we used to compile simpatico on a multi-core Mac laptop, using a copy of the &lt;a <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org">http://www.open-mpi.org</a>&gt;openmpi library that was compiled from source.</p>
<p>If you do not use a module system, and the settings provided for gcc with openmpi do not work, you may have to edit the CXXFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS variables to reflect the locations of the header and library files for the MPI library on your machine. If you have not compiled an MPI program on a particular machine, you may need to do a bit of searching to identify the appropriate paths and/or ask for help from a local guru.</p>
<p>During compilation, MPI is enabled only if the the makefile variable UTIL_MPI has been defined and set equal to 1 in the file src/compiler.mk. This variable is defined automatically by the ddMd and mcmd-mpi makefile targets that compile programs that require MPI, so users should not need to set it explicitly.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_ddMd_section"></a>
Compiling ddSim</h1>
<p>To compile the ddSim parallel MD program, after checking the compiler settings for MPI (as discussed above), simply enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make ddMd</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the simpatico root directory.</p>
<p>If successful, invoking "make ddMd" will install an executable named ddSim in the simpatico/bin/ directory. To accomplish this, this makefile target will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call "./configure -m1" from the root directory, to enable MPI</li>
<li>Compile mpi-enabled versions of all of the classes in the src/util/, src/inter/, and src/ddMd directories</li>
<li>Create MPI-enabled versions of the libraries that contain objects from these three directories</li>
<li>Build the ddSim executable</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting versions of the libraries containing objects from the src/util/, src/inter and src/ddMd directories will be named lib/libutil_m.a, lib/libinter_m.a, and lib/libddMd.a, respectively. The addition of a suffix "_m" to the names of the libutil and libinter libraries is used to identify MPI-enabled versions of these libraries.</p>
<p>By default, the parallel MD executable is named ddSim. The executable name is defined by the variable DDSIM_EXE, which is defined in file src/ddMd/defines.mk, which users may modify.</p>
<p>To clean up files created by compiling ddSim, enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make clean-ddMd</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the root directory. This will remove the *.o object files, mpi-enabled libraries, and the ddSim executable that were created by "make ddMd".</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_multi_section"></a>
Compiling mcSim and mdSim (multi-processor versions)</h1>
<p>Multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim can be used to run:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple completely independent simulations as an MPI job, with separate parameter files</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Multiple simulations with a sequence of parameter values specified in a single parameter file</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Replica exchange simulations, which also rely on the free energy perturbation theory feature</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two applications require the use of the free energy perturbation feature, which is discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_multi_McMd_page.html">here</a>. The free energy perturbation feature is enabled by default when MPI is enabled.</p>
<p>To compile multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim, if automatic dependency generation is enabled (the default), simply enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make mcMd-mpi</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the root directory. By default, the resulting executable files are named mcSim_m and mdSim_m, using a suffix "_m" to distinguish multi-processor executables from the single processor versions of mcSim and mdSim. To build these executables, this command will compile mpi-enabled versions of all of the source files in the mcMd/ directory and (if needed) the util/ and inter/ directories, and create mpi-enabled versions of corresponding library file(s).</p>
<p>If automatic automatic dependency generation has been disabled, then users should enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make clean-McMd</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the root directory before entering "make mcMd-mpi", in order to remove object files and libraries that may have been created with MPI disabled, and force recompilation of the corresponding source files.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_doc_section"></a>
Generating html documentation</h1>
<p>The html documentation you are reading was generated using the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen </a> documentation utility. Neither the git repository nor the downoadable version of the source codecontain a copy of the html documentation files. If desired, you may use doxygen to generate a local copy of the web documentation. If dOxygen is installed on your machine, you can regenerate all of the html documentation by entering </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make html </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the simpatico root directory. The resulting html documentation is deposited in the doc/html/ directory.</p>
<p>To begin reading the main page of the documentation, open the file simpatico/doc/html/index.html in any web browser, e.g., by entering "firefox doc/html/index.html" on linux or "open doc/html/index.html" on a Mac.</p>
<p>The text of the page you are reading now, along with others that are not extracted from C++ files, is in a set of files in the doc/dox directory. These are written in plain text, and can also be read with any text editor. Documentation for each C++ class is extracted by doxygen from documentation blocks in the class header file.</p>
<p>To remove all the html documentation in the doc/html directory, enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make clean-html</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the root directory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_config_section"></a>
Configuration Files</h1>
<p>The ./setup script creates editable of several makefile fragments that users may need to modify to control various aspects of compilation. These files are: </p>
<pre class="fragment">- src/compiler.mk

- src/util/defines.mk

- src/inter/defines.mk

- src/mcMd/defines.mk

- src/ddMd/defines.mk
</pre><p>None of these files are in the git repository, or in the gzipped tar archive of the source code. Initial versions of each of these files are instead created by the setup script by making copies of default (repository) versions of each file. The repository version of each such file is a file with the same name as the configuration file plus a suffix "_r" (for repository), and is located in the same directory as the configuration file. Thus, for example, an initial version of the file src/mcMd/defines.mk is created by the setup script by copying src/mcMd/defines.mk_r.</p>
<p>The most common modifications of these configuration files can be carried out using the configure script, but some changes require manual editing. Users can modify these *.mk files as needed, but should avoid modifying the corresonding "*.mk_r" repository versions.</p>
<p>Contents of the configuration files:</p>
<p>The file src/compiler.mk defines makefile variables that specify the choice of C++ compiler, MPI library, and compiler options, as discussed above. It also defines variables ROOT_DIR, SRC_DIR, BIN_DIR, and LIB_DIR that represent paths to the simpatico root directory, the source directory, and the directories in which executables and libraries will be installed. This file also contain contains definitions of the variable MAKEDEP that (if not commented out) enables automatic dependency generation, and the variable UTIL_MPI that enables MPI.</p>
<p>The makefile fragments src/util/defines.mk, src/inter/defines.mk, mcMd/defines.mk, and ddMd/defines.mk can be used to define makefile variables that enable or disable other optional features of the code at compile time. Each of these files contains one or more commented out definitions for makefile variables that, when uncommented, enable particular features during compilation. All available compile-time options are discussed <a class="el" href="user_options_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The setup script also creates default versions of several *.cpp C++ source files. These are also files that users may need to modify in order to customize or extend some aspect of a simulation. Each of these files is created by copying a default version whose name is obtained by adding a suffix _r to the name of the user version.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Because the setup script creates some C++ files that users may subsequently modify, users should be careful to NOT call the setup script after modifying any of these files, unless modified files are first saved under different names. It should not be necesary to call ./setup more than once. Doing will cause any modified versions of such files to be overwritten by the default versions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compile_dependency_section"></a>
Automatic Dependency Generation</h1>
<p>When automatic dependency generation is enabled (the default), the build system generates a "dependency" file, with a suffix *.d, whenever it compiles *.cpp source file. Each dependency file lists all of the files upon which the resulting *.o object file depends, including the source file an all header files that are included directly or indirectly into the source file. Generation of dependency files may be disabled entering "./configure -k0" from the root directory. Automatic dependency generation is not strictly necessary for users who want to compile the code as is, without modifying or adding any C++ files. It is essential, however, for developers, because it allows make to keep track of what files have to recompiled when any file is modified.</p>
<p>If dependency generation is disabled, the only safe way to recompile the code after changing any C++ file or makefile is to do a clean rebuild, by entering "make clean", "make mcMd", "make ddSim" or "make mcMd-mpi" from the root directory before recompiling.</p>
<p>The system for automatic dependency generation uses both the gnu g++ compiler (which does actual analysis of dependencies) and several python scripts. To function, the system requires that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A g++ compiler executable (or a link with this name) exists in users PATH</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A python executable is accessible in the users PATH</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The simpatico/tools/python/ directory is in the PYTHONPATH environment variable</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The makefile variable MAKEDEP is defined in the file src/compiler.mk (it is defined by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the g++ compiler is used for dependency analysis even if another compiler (e.g., intel) is used to actually compile the code.</p>
<p>Automatic dependency generation works by applying the script bin/makeDep to each *.cpp source file whenever that file is compiled. This behavior is dictated by the pattern rules defined in the patterns.mk files in the src/util/, src/inter/, src/mcMd/, and src/ddMd/ directories. Whenever a *.cpp file is compiled, the makeDep script generates a corresponding *.d file with the same base name. Each *.d dependency file defines a makefile rule for the corresponding *.o object makefile file target. This rule contains a list of all the files upon which that object file depends. This dependency list contains the associated *.cpp file and all of the *.h header files that this source file includes, including header files that are included indirectly. Once such a dependency file exists, it will be used the next time "make" is invoked in order to determine if the corresponding *.o object file needs to be recreated as a result of changes in any files upon which it depends.</p>
<p>The dependency list for every *.o file contains the files src/compiler.mk and one or more of the defines.mk files, in addition to C++ source and header files. This is because these makefile fragments contain definitions of compiler options and C++ preprocessor macros that control conditional compilation, and can thus effect the result object code. Modification of these makefile fragments can thus force recompilation of a large number C++ source files. Modifying src/compiler.mk or src/util/defines.mk forces recompilation of every file in the src/ directory. Modifying src/inter/defines.mk force recompilation of all source files in the src/inter, src/mcMd, and src/ddMd directories. Modifying src/mcMd/defines.mk forces recompilation of all files in src/mcMd. Modifying src/ddMd/defines.mk forces recompilation of all files in src/ddMd.</p>
