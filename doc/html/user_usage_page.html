</p>
<p>This section describes how to execute the simpatico programs mcSim, mdSim and ddSim.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage_inputs"></a>
Input Files</h1>
<p>Each simpatico simulation normally requires three input files: </p>
<ul>
<li>
a <a class="el" href="user_usage_page.html#usage_parameter_section">parameter</a> file  </li>
<li>
a <a class="el" href="user_usage_page.html#usage_command_section">command</a> file  </li>
<li>
a <a class="el" href="user_usage_page.html#usage_cfgfile_section">configuration</a> file  </li>
</ul>
<p>The contents and formats of these different types of file are discussed briefly below and in more detail in several separate pages (see <a class="el" href="user_param_page.html">2.3 Parameter Files</a> , <a class="el" href="user_commands_page.html">2.4 Command File</a> and <a class="el" href="user_cfgfile_page.html">2.5 Configuration Files</a>).</p>
<p>When a program is executed, the parameter file is usually read from standard input. The parameter file contains the name of the command file, which is read next. The command file contains a list of commands that are interpreted and executed in sequence. Among these is normally a command that instructs the program to read a specific input configuration file, and a command that runs a simulation of a specified number of steps, and a command to write a final configuration file.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage_running_section"></a>
Running a Simulation</h1>
<p>To run a simulation, one invokes the executable name and reads the parameter file from standard input. For example, to run a single-processor mdSim MD simulation, using a parameter file named "param" in the current working directory, one would enter: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">mdSim &lt; param</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> To run a single-processor MC simulation, one would instead enter "mcSim &lt; param". During execution, some information is sent to standard output (i.e., the screen). This log output can be directed to a file using, for example, </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">mdSim &lt; param &gt; log</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Standard output should always be redirected to a file when a job is run in background or in a queue.</p>
<p>The syntax for executing the parallel ddSim program is similar, except for the need to run the program as an MPI program. The syntax for starting an MPI job depends on the system configuration and choice of library, but often involves a script called "mpirun". To use mpirun to start a ddSim program on 32 processors, using a parameter file named param in the working directory, one would enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">mpirun -np 32 ddSim &lt; param &gt; log</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> For a ddSim job, the number of processors declared in the command line (e.g., 32 in this example) must be consistent with the number of processors in the processor grid defined in the Domain block of the parameter file (e.g., a 4 x 4 x 2 processor grid).</p>
<p>The available command line options for each program are discussed <a class="el" href="user_usage_page.html#section_options">below</a>. The most commonly used option is the "-e" (echo) option, as in </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">mdSim -e &lt; param &gt; log</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This option causes each line of the parameter file to be echoed to standard output as it is read. It is useful for locating errors in the parameter file syntax, because the echoed output ends immediately before an error is detected, and is followed by a message explaining the nature of the error. The first line that does not appear is usually the one that causing trouble.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage_program_section"></a>
Program structure</h1>
<p>The understand the program flow, it helps to look briefly at the structure of the main program. The main program files for single processor MC and MD simulations are <a class="el" href="mcSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mcSim.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp</a>. The main program for parallel MD simulation is <a class="el" href="ddSim_8cpp_source.html">src/ddMd/ddSim.cpp</a>. All three programs have a similar structure. Shown below is a slightly simplified version of the main program <a class="el" href="mcSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mcSim.cpp</a> for MC simulations: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">int</span> main(<span class="keywordtype">int</span> argc, <span class="keywordtype">char</span>** argv)</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">   <a class="code" href="classMcMd_1_1McSimulation.html" title="A Monte-Carlo simulation of one McSystem.">McMd::McSimulation</a> simulation;</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">   \\ Process command line options</div>
<div class="line">   simulation.<a class="code" href="classMcMd_1_1McSimulation.html#a913a54f9d2f6ee42dbd6aad6ebeac486" title="Process command line options.">setOptions</a>(argc, argv);</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">   \\ Read the parameter file from standard input</div>
<div class="line">   simulation.<a class="code" href="classMcMd_1_1McSimulation.html#ada2e9f506b67f1d0d6aba05c9280ee7e" title="Read parameter file.">readParam</a>();</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">   \\ Read the command file.</div>
<div class="line">   simulation.<a class="code" href="classMcMd_1_1McSimulation.html#ac743d5ae517c8da8f087e573635d11da" title="Read and execute commands from a specific input stream.">readCommands</a>();</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This program has only four executable lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first executable line creates an object named simulation that is an instance of the class <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1McSimulation.html" title="A Monte-Carlo simulation of one McSystem.">McMd::McSimulation</a>. An McSimulation object represents a complete Monte Carlo simulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The setOptions() method processes any command line options that are passed to the program. The available command line options are discussed <a class="el" href="user_usage_page.html#section_options">below</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The readParam() method reads a parameter file and initializes the simulation. Invoking readParam() with no argument (as here) reads the parameter file from standard input.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The readCommands() method reads the command file, and executes each command as it is read.</li>
</ul>
<p>The readParam() method does more than read parameters: It is an initialization function that reads parameters, allocates any required memory, and leaves the main simulation object ready for use. The name of the command file is specified in the param file.</p>
<p>The analogous code for the single-processor MD (mdSim) and parallel MD (ddSim) programs are almost identical. The only difference is that the main object in <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">mdSim.cpp</a> is an instance of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSimulation.html" title="A molecular dynamics simulation of a single MdSystem.">McMd::MdSimulation</a>, and the main object in ddSim.ccpp is an instance of <a class="el" href="classDdMd_1_1Simulation.html" title="Main object for a domain-decomposition MD simulation.">DdMd::Simulation</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage_parameter_section"></a>
Parameter File</h1>
<p>The parameter file contains all the data required to initialize a simulation, i.e., to initialize all variables to valid values and to allocate all required memory. This data includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters that control how much memory should be allocated for use during a simulation, such as the maximum allowable number of atoms or molecules.</li>
<li>Physical parameters such as the temperature and potential energy parameters.</li>
<li>Choices of specific simulation algorithms, such as the set of Monte Carlo moves for a MC simulation or the integration algorithm for an MD simulation, and parameters requierd by these algorithms (e.g,. the time step for an MD integrator).</li>
<li>Choices of any desired data analysis and/or data output operations, and associated parameter values.</li>
</ul>
<p>In mcSim and mdSim simulations, the parameter file also contains data required to describe molecular species. In ddSim simulations, this information about molecular topology is instead embedded in the configuration file (discussed below). The parameter file also contains the filename for the command file that should be read by the readCommands() method. Examples of parameter file formats for different types of simulation are shown and discussed <a class="el" href="user_param_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage_command_section"></a>
Command File</h1>
<p>The command file contains a sequence of commands that are read and executed in the order they appear. Each line of the command file starts with a capitalized command name, followed by zero or more arguments. The minimal command file for an mcSim simulation looks like this: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">READ_CONFIG       config</div>
<div class="line">SIMULATE          100000</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_CONFIG      config</div>
<div class="line">FINISH   </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This file instructs the program to read a configuration file named "config", run a simulation of 100000 attempted MC moves, write a final output configuration file to a file named "config", and then stop. The command file is read by a loop that terminates when a line containing only the command FINISH is encountered. A full list of valid commands and their arguments is given <a class="el" href="user_commands_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Paths for the input and output files specified in the command file are constructed by concatenating input and output prefix strings that are specified in the parameter file (named inputPrefix and outputPrefix) to file names specified in the command file. The values of these prefix strings are often set to directory name strings, which end with a directory separator symbol "/", in order to place all input files and output files in different directories. The fact that the above example command script uses the same name "config" for both the input and output configuration files thus does not necessarily mean that the script would cause the input configuration file to be overwritten, sinceinput and output files are normally placed in different directories.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage_cfgfile_section"></a>
Configuration File</h1>
<p>A configuration file specifies atomic positions and other characteristics of a system that can change during the course of a simulation. Slightly different information is required by mcSim, mdSim, and ddSim. A default configuration file format exists for each of the three programs, each of which can also read and write files using a several other file formats.</p>
<p>The default configuration file format for mcSim contains the dimensions of the periodic system boundary, the number of molecules of each molecular species, and the positions of all atoms. The default file mdSim also contains the atomic velocities. The default configuration file formats for these two programs do not contain any information about molecular topology (which atom is connected to which), because this is contained in the param file format for these programs.</p>
<p>The default configuration file format for ddSim contains box dimensions, atomic positions and velocities. Unlike the file formats for mcSim and mdSim, this format also contains structural information about bonds, and any angle and dihedral groups.</p>
<p>Configuration file formats for all programs are described in more detail <a class="el" href="user_cfgfile_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage_output_section"></a>
Output Files</h1>
<p>Each simulation writes a limited amount of information to report the progress of the simulation. In simulations of single system (i.e., using ddSim or the single-processor versions of mdSim and mcSim), this is written to standard output, but can redirected to a log file.</p>
<p>A typical command file contains a command to write a final system configuration to a file. The parameter file may also specify that the system configuration be dumped to file periodically during a simulation.</p>
<p>A variety of other output files may also be written by classes that implement on-the-fly statistical analyses or data output operations. These data analysis and data output classes are all subclasses of the Diagnostic base class. The parameter file may specify a set of Diagnostic objects that should used during a simulation, each of which samples or outputs data at a specified interval, and each of which writes its output to one or more separate files. The path to each such output files is constructed by prepending a common outputPrefix string to a base name that is specified in the parameter file.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="section_options"></a>
Command Line Options</h1>
<p>All simpatico programs can be invoked with either or both of the following two command line options: </p>
<ul>
<li>
-e: Activates echoing of the parameter file to standard output. </li>
<li>
-r filename: Restarts and continues a previous simulation.   </li>
</ul>
<p>The -e (echo) option causes each parameter in the parameter file to be echoed to standard output immediately after it is read. This is very useful for locating the position of an error in the parameter file.</p>
<p>The -r (restart) option takes a required parameter "filename". This is the base name of two input files required to restart a simulation, which have filename suffixes *.rst, (restart file) and *.cmd (restart command file). Restarting is discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_restart_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim can also be invoked with an option "-f" that enables the use of a free energy perturbation, for use with thermodynamic integration or replica exchange algorithms. This option causes all of the processors to read data from a single parameter file that contains information about how to set a series of different parameter values on different processors. This option is discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_multi_McMd_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The ddSim parallel MD program can be invoked with an option "-s" (split) that enables simulation of several independent systems. The -s (split) option takes a required parameter p, whose value is the number of independent systems that should be simulated. Invoking ddSim with this option causes the MPI communicator to be split into p subcommunicators, each of which is used to run a separate parallel MD simulation. The total number of processors requested for a job must thus be a multiple of p. This option is discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="user_multi_DdMd_page.html">here</a>.</p>
