<h1>Configuration File </h1>  </div>

<div class="textblock"><p>The instantaneous state of a system is recorded in a configuration file. The configuration file always contains the dimensions of the periodic boundary, and the positions of all atoms. Configuration file formats that are designed for use with MD simulations also contain atomic velocities. Simpatico is able to read and write configuration files in several formats.</p>
<p>The default formats for MC and MD simulations are very simple text files. Below is an example of the default format for a very small MC simulation. This example is for a simulation of a mixture of two species, labelled 0 and 1, in which molecules of species 0 have two atoms and molecules of species 1 have 3 atoms. The number of species and the number of atoms per molecule is specified in the parameter file, which must be read before any configuration file. The number of molecules of each species in the configuration file must be less than or equal to the capacity specified for that species in the parameter file. The configuration shown here is for a system with an orthorhombic periodic boundary with dimensions [Lx], [Ly], and [Lz] that contains three molecules of species 0 and one molecule of species 1. Here, we use [Lx], [Ly] and [Lz] to represent values of the boundary dimensions, and [x] [y] and [z] to represent values of Cartesian coordinates for individual atoms: </p>

</pre></div><p> The default file format for an MD simulation is similar, except that it includes Cartesian velocity components for each atom as well as coordinates. In the default MD format, the line associated with each atom thus contains the three coordinates x, y, z, followed by the three velocity components vx, vy, vz.</p>
<p>The configuration file does not normally contain information about the chemical structure of each species. This is instead specified for each species within the parameter file. The exception to this is the special case of a "mutable" species, which is a species in which each molecule can be in any of an enumerable number of internal states (e.g., for semi-grand canonical ensemble simulations), for which the configuration file contains one additional index per molecule that can be used to specify the internal state of the molecule.</p>
<p>A configuration file is written and read by a <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1ConfigIo.html" title="System configuration file reader and writer.">ConfigIo</a> object that is associated with a <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1System.html" title="A set of interacting Molecules enclosed by a Boundary.">System</a> object. By default, an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1McSystem.html" title="A System for use in a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.">McSystem</a> uses a <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1McConfigIo.html" title="ConfigIo for MC simulations (no atom velocities).">McConfigIo</a> object, which implements the MC file format depicted above. By default, an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSystem.html" title="A System for Molecular Dynamics simulation.">MdSystem</a> uses a <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdConfigIo.html" title="ConfigIo for MD simulations (includes velocities).">MdConfigIo</a>, which implements a similar file format in which the velocities are added to each line, as discussed above. These default formats are used by READ_CONFIG and WRITE_CONFIG commands if they appear in the command file before any SET_CONFIG_IO commands.</p>
<p>The SET_CONFIG_IO command in the command file can be used to change the configuration file format used to read or write configuration files. This command takes the name of a subclass of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1ConfigIo.html" title="System configuration file reader and writer.">ConfigIo</a> as an argument, and causes subsequent READ_CONFIG and WRITE_CONFIG commands to use a new instance of the specified subclass to read and/or write configuration files. For example, in the command file for an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSimulation.html" title="A molecular dynamics simulation of a single MdSystem.">MdSimulation</a>, adding a command "SET_CONFIG_IO McConfigIo" just before a READ_CONFIG command will cause the MC file format to be used to parse the input configuration file, rather than the default MD file format. Because the MC file format does not contain any information about velocities, this pair of commands would normally be followed in the file for an <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1MdSimulation.html" title="A molecular dynamics simulation of a single MdSystem.">MdSimulation</a> by a THERMALIZE command, to generate random velocities chosen from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. A SET_CONFIG_IO command can be inserted just before a subsequent WRITE_CONFIG command to control the file format used to output a final configuration file. A command file that contains only SET_CONFIG_IO commands can be used to convert between file formats.</p>
