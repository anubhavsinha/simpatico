<p>Simpatico is compiled using a system of unix makefiles. All development was done using gnu make (gmake).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_files"></a>
Source Directory</h2>
<p>All C++ files for Simpatico, including both header (*.h) and source (*.cpp) files, are in subdirectories of the src/ directory. The header and source file for each class are in the same directory. The name of each such file is the same as the class name, followed by the extension .h or .cpp. All class names and corresponding file names are upper space camel (like <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1Vector.html" title="A Vector is a Cartesian vector.">Util::Vector</a> or <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Species.html" title="A Species represents a set of chemically similar molecules.">McMd::Species</a>).</p>
<p>The src/util, src/inter, src/mcMd, and src/ddMd directories each contain all the source files for a particular C++ namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>src/util/ contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>src/inter/ contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>src/mcMd/ contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>src/ddMd contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<p>These four directories will thus be referred to in what follows as "namespace" level directories.</p>
<p>By convention, classes in the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace may use names defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> namespace, but classes in the <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace do not use names defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace, and classes in the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace may not use names defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace. Classes in namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> may use names defined in namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a>, but not names defined in <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> or <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a>. We may summarize these relationships by speaking of one namespace being "dependent" on another:</p>
<ul>
<li>namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> depends on namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> depends on namespaces <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main program <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">mdSim.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="mcSim_8cpp_source.html">mcSim.cpp</a> for single processor operation are in the src/mcMd directory. The main program <a class="el" href="ddSim_8cpp_source.html">ddSim.cpp</a> for parallel MD simulations is in the src/ddMd directory.</p>
<p>Each of the namespace level source directories contains a subdirectory named tests/ that contains unit tests for classes in the associated name space. These unit tests are not automatically compiled or run by the build system that compiles the source code.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_object"></a>
Object Directories</h2>
<p>Compiling a source file with extension *.cpp normally creates both an object file, with file name extension *.o, and a dependency file, with extension *.d. (The dependency file is not created if automatic dependency generation has been disabled.) These two generated files have the same base name as the corresponding source file, with the .cpp extension replaced by .o or .d. The dependency file is created as a side effect of compilation, and contains a makefile target that lists the header files that are included by the source file, along with other dependencies.</p>
<p>The object and dependency file that are created by compiling a source file are normally placed in a directory outside of the src/ directory tree. This is referred to as an "out-of-source" build. It is also possible, however, to build a program within the src/ directory, by placing the object and dependency file in the same directory as the source file, thus executing an "in-source" build. The simpatico/obj/ directory contains two subdirectories, named obj/serial and obj/parallel, that can be used to hold object and dependency files created during an out-of-source build. The obj/serial directory is normally used to hold object files that are created during compilation of the single-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim. The obj/parallel/ directory is normally used to hold object files that are created during compilation the multi-processor versions of mdSim and mcSim (named mdSim_m and mcSim_m) and the ddSim parallel MD program, which all require MPI.</p>
<p>In what follows, we will refer to the obj/serial, obj/parallel, and src/ directories collectively as object directories. Any of these three directories can be used to hold the object files that are generated during the process of building a program. The obj/serial and obj/parallel directories each contain a tree of subdirectories with the same structure as that of the src/ directory tree. When a source file from a directory in the src/ directory is compiled, the resulting object file and dependency file are placed in the analogous subdirectory of the relevant object directory tree. During an in-source build, the object and source directories are the same, and so the object and dependency files are thus placed in the same directory as the source file.</p>
<p>After the setup script has been run, but before any code is compiled, each of the object directories contain the following files and subdirectories: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">   OBJ_DIR/
      makefile
      compiler.mk
      compiler.mk_r
      configure
      util/
      inter/
      mcMd/
      ddMd/
</pre></div><p> Here we use the OBJ_DIR to represent the path to the relevant object directory. The files in the main object directory OBJ_DIR are:</p>
<ul>
<li>makefile is the main makefile for building a program in a particular object directory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>compiler.mk is the main build configuration file, which users may need to modify.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>compiler.mk_r is a default repository version of compiler.mk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>configure is a bash script that can be used to enable or disable specific features before compiling</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the four namespace level subdirectories (util/, inter/, mcMd/ and ddMd/) contains an additional set of files of the form: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">   <span class="keyword">namespace</span>/
      makefile
      defines.mk
      defines.mk_r
      \tests
         makefile
</pre></div><p> Here, we use "namespace/" to represent the namespace level directory name util/, inter/, mcMd/ or ddMd/. The files in each namespace level directory have the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>namespace/makefile is the main makefile for a single namespace.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>namespace/defines.mk file is a build configuration file that controls features relevant to this namespace.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>namespace/defines.mk_r is a default repository version of namespace/defines.mk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file OBJ_DIR/namespace/makefile in each namespace level subdirectory of the object directory defines an "all" target that compiles all of the source files in the corresponding subdirectory of src/, and which builds a static library that contains all of the result objects.</p>
<p>The makefile system that is used to build the source code does not automatically compile or run the unit tests. Unit tests for each namespace may be compiled by cd'ing to the tests/ subdirectory of the relevant namespace-level directory, entering "make all" from there to compile all tests, and then entering "make run" to run them.</p>
<p>The obj/serial and obj/parallel directories are initially empty except for the files listed above. The same set of files also exist in the src/ directory, but appear there alongside source files and a variety of other files.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_configuration"></a>
Build Configuration Files</h2>
<p>The OBJ_DIR/compiler.mk and OBJ_DIR/namespace/defines.mk files will be referred to in what follows as build configuration files. Each of these files is a makefile fragment that is created by the setup script by making a copy of the file of the same name with extension *.mk_r in the same directory. These files are included by object directory and namespace level makefiles.</p>
<p>The file OBJ_DIR/compiler.mk defines variables that contain absolute paths to the source, object, and binary directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>SRC_DIR contains the absolute path to the simpatico/src/ directory.</li>
<li>OBJ_DIR contains the absolute path to the object directory</li>
<li>BIN_DIR contains the absolute path to the directory in which executables are installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>OBJ_DIR expands to the absolute path for the directory that contains the compiler.mk file. By default, BIN_DIR points to the simpatico/bin directory. These three paths are expressed in terms of a variable ROOT_DIR that contains the absolute path to the simpatico root directory. The correct value for ROOT_DIR is set by the setup script. Here is an example of the relevant part of the file obj/serial/compiler.mk: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">ROOT_DIR=PARENT/simpatico
SRC_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/src
OBJ_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/obj/serial
BIN_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/bin
</pre></div><p> Here, PARENT is used represent an absolute path to the directory that contains the simpatico/ root directory. In the actual file, this would be replaced by the literal absolute path to this parent directory. In the compiler.mk files in the obj/parallel and src/ directories, the value of OBJ_DIR would be set to ROOT_DIR/obj/parallel and ROOT_DIR/src, respectively.</p>
<p>The "defines.mk" file in each of the namespace level subdirectories contains definitions of makefile variables that may be commented out to disable or uncommented to enable particular features of the code defined in the associated namespace. For example, the definition of a variable INTER_ANGLE in the file inter/defines.mk may be commented out to disable 3-body angle potentials or uncommented to enable angle potentials. Similarly, the definition of UTIL_DEBUG in the file util/defines.mk can commented out to disnable extra sanity checks that are intended for the debug version of the code, or uncommented to enable these checks.</p>
<p>Each "defines.mk" file defines a variable with a name UTIL_DEFS, INTER_DEFS, MCMD_DEFS, or DDMD_DEFS, for the defines.mk file in the util/, inter/, mcMd/, or ddMd/ directory, respectively. Each of these variables has a name of the form NAMESPACE_DEFS, where NAMESPACE represents an upper case form of the name of the corresponding C++ namespace (i.e., UTIL, INTER, MCMD or DDMD). Each such NAMESPACE_DEFS variables expands to a (possibly empty) string that can be passed to the compiler to define C++ preprocessor macros, using the compiler "-D" option. Thus for example, if angle potentials are enabled by defining the makefile variable INTER_ANGLE in the file OBJ_DIR/inter/defines.mk, the variable INTER_DEFS will contain a string "-DINTER_ANGLE" that, when passed to the compiler as a command line option, causes the compiler to define a corresponding C++ preprocessor macro named INTER_ANGLE. This preprocessor macro is used throughout the source files in the inter/, mcMd/ and ddMd/ directories to conditionally compile sections of code that are only needed if angle potentials are enabled. The preprocessor macros that are (optionally) defined in each NAMESPACE_DEFS variable are only used in the source code of the corresponding namespace and in namespaces that depends upon it. Thus for example, preprocessor macros defined by the MCMD_DEFS string can only appear in source files in the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespce, since no other namespace depends on the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace. Preprocessor macros defined by the UTIL_DEFS string, however, can effect source code in any of the four namespaces, since the <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a>, <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespaces all depend upon the <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a> namespace (i.e., may all use classes or other names that are defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a> namespace).</p>
<p>The "configure" script in each object directory may be used edit the compiler.mk and defines.mk build configuration files from the command line, in order to enable or disable specific features. This script must be invoked from the main object directory, and use different command line options to enable or disable specific features. For example, the command to enable MPI is </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">  ./configure -m1
</pre></div><p> The corresponding command to disable MPI is "./configre -m0". Here, the -m option denotes MPI, while the argument 1 is used to enable MPI or 0 to disable MPI. The configure script in each object directory edits only the build configuration files in the same directory.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_main"></a>
Top-Level Makefiles</h2>
<p>The main makefile in each object directory (obj/serial, obj/parallel, and src/) has three primary targets named "mcMd", "mcSim-mpi" and "ddSim.</p>
<p>-"make mcMd" builds the single-processor mcSim and mdSim programs. -"make mcMd-mpi" builds multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim. -"make ddMd" builds the ddSim program.</p>
<p>Each of these primary targets places the object and dependency files in the object directory from which make was invoked and then installs the resulting executable file or files (by default) in the simpatico/bin/ directory. An in-source build can be executed (if desired) by invoking make with the appropriate target from within the src/ directory.</p>
<p>The simpatico/ root directory also has a master makefile with the same three targets, "mcMd", "mcMd-mpi" and "ddSim". Invoking any of these targets from the root directory simply causes make to descend to the appropriate object directory (i.e., to obj/serial for serial programs and to obj/parallel for MPI programs) and then recursively invoke make with the same target from within this object directory. The relevant part of the makefile thus looks like this: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">all:
   make mcMd
   make mcMd-mpi
   make ddSim

mcMd:
   cd obj/serial; make mcMd

mcMd-mpi:
   cd obj/parallel; make mcMd-mpi

ddMd:
   cd obj/parallel; make ddMd
</pre></div><p> The default "all" target of the root directory makefile simply builds all three main makefile targets in sequence.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_namespace"></a>
Namespace Level Makefiles</h2>
<p>Each of the object directories contains four namespace level subdirectories named util/, inter/, mcMd/ and ddMd/. Each of these namespace level subdirectories contains a makefile with an "all" target that compiles all of the source files in corresponding subdirectory of src/, or in the corresponding namespace. In addition, the "all" target in each namespace level makefile creates a static library that contains the object files for all of the classes in that namespace. Program executables are built by linking to these namespace level static libraries rather than by directly linking to the object files.The base name of each such library is given by "lib" followed by the namespace level directory name and a ".a" file extension. Each such library is placed in the namespace level subdirectory of the object directory. For example, the makefile in the OBJ_DIR/util/ subdirectory creates a static library that (by default) is named OBJ_DIR/util/libutil.a.</p>
<p>The "all" targets in the makefiles in the OJB_DIR/mcMd and OBJ_DIR/ddMd subdirectories also compile associated main programs and create executables. Entering "make all" from the OBJ_DIR/mcMd directory compiles and links the main programs <a class="el" href="mcSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mcSim.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp</a> to create mcSim and mdSim executables, in addition to compiling all of the required class files and building associated libraries. Entering "make all" from src/ddMd compiles and links <a class="el" href="ddSim_8cpp_source.html">src/ddMd/ddSim.cpp</a> to create the ddSim executable.</p>
<p>The "mcMd", "mcMd-mpi" and "ddMd" targets of the main object directory makefiles all use the configure script to first enable or disable MPI, as appropriate, and then recursively invoke the "all" targets of all of the namespace level makefiles required for the target program or programs. The relevant parts of the OBJ_DIR/makefile file in any of the three object directories all look like this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">mcMd:
        ./configure -m0
        cd util;  make all
        cd inter; make all
        cd mcMd;  make all

mcMd-mpi:
        ./configure -m1
        cd util;  make all
        cd inter; make all
        cd mcMd;  make all

ddMd:
        ./configure -m1
        cd util;  make all
        cd inter; make all
        cd ddMd;  make all
</pre></div><p> The command "./configure -m0" or "./configure -m1" uses the configure script in the same object directory to either disable ("./configure -m0") or enable ("./configure -m1") conditional compilation of parts of the code that use an MPI library. Note that the only difference between the the "mcMd" and "mcMd-mpi" targets is that the "mcMd" target disables MPI before compiling any source files, while "mcMd-mpi" enables MPI before compiling. The ddMd target always enables MPI, because it is essential to the functioning of the target program.</p>
<p>All of the real work thus done by the "all" targets of the namespace level makefiles in the util/, inter/, mcMd/ and ddMd/ subdirectorie of each object directory. Unlike the upper level makefiles in the simpatico/ root directory and in the object directories, the namespace level makefiles do not use a recursive make algorithm, i.e., they do not recursively invoke make in yet lower level subdirectories. Instead, the "all" target compiles all of the source files listed in a makefile variable.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_sources"></a>
Source File Lists</h2>
<p>Every subdirectory of src/ (other than the tests/ directory) contains a makefile fragment named "sources.mk". Each such file defines a variable that contains a list of relative paths for all of the source files in that directory and all of its subdirectories (if any). In each such subdirectory of src/, this variable has a name of the form [directory]_, where "[directory]" represents a mangled form of the subdirectory name. Specifically, [directory] is constructed by taking the path from the src/ directory to the subdirectory of interest and replacing each "/" directory separator by an underscore ("_"). For example, the file src/util/sources.mk defines a variable util_ that expands to a list of all of the source files in the directory tree rooted at src/util. The file src/util/space/sources.mk defines a corresponding variable named util_space_. The value of the [directory]_ variable is a list of relative paths for all source files in the corresponding directory and its descendant subdirectories, in which each path is expressed relative to the src/ directory.</p>
<p>The code that defines a [directory]_ variable is straightforward in directories that contain source files but no subdirectories, such as the util/space directory. For example, here is the definition of util_space_ from the file src/util/space/sources.mk: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">util_space_=\
    util/space/Grid.cpp \
    util/space/IntVector.cpp \
    util/space/Tensor.cpp \
    util/space/Vector.cpp 
</pre></div><p> The directory src/util/space contains four sources files named <a class="el" href="Grid_8cpp_source.html">Grid.cpp</a>, <a class="el" href="IntVector_8cpp_source.html">IntVector.cpp</a>, <a class="el" href="Vector_8cpp_source.html">Vector.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="Tensor_8cpp_source.html">Tensor.cpp</a>, and has no subdirectories.</p>
<p>In source file directories that contain subdirectories, the source file list is constructed by combining corresponding lists defined in subdirectories. In each such directory, the file "sources.mk" in the parent directory must include the sources.mk files from all of subdirectories. The value of the [directory]_ variable for the parent directory is then constructed, wholely or in part, by concatenating values of the [subdirectory]_ variables defined in the subdirectories. For example, here is the definition of util_ from the file src/util/sources.mk: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="preprocessor"># Include subdirectory sources.mk files</span>
<span class="preprocessor"></span>include $(SRC_DIR)/util/misc/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/format/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/containers/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/mpi/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/signal/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/param/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/math/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/space/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/random/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/boundary/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/crystal/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/ensembles/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/accumulators/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/archives/sources.mk

<span class="preprocessor"># Concatenate subdirectory source file lists</span>
<span class="preprocessor"></span>util_=$(util_misc_) $(util_format_) \
    $(util_containers_) $(util_mpi_) \
    $(util_signal_) $(util_param_) $(util_math_) \
    $(util_space_) $(util_random_) $(util_boundary_) \
    $(util_crystal_) $(util_ensembles_) \
    $(util_accumulators_) $(util_archives_)
</pre></div><p> The first segment of the file is a set of include statements that include the sources.mk files from all subdirectories of src/util.</p>
<p>The sources.mk file in each such subdirectory of src/ also defines two other variables that expand into lists of absolute paths for source and object files. These variables have names of the form [directory]_SRCS and [directory]_OBJS, respectively, where [directory] again represents the mangled directory name. Thus, for example, the file src/util/sources.mk defines variables named util_SRCS and util_OBJS, in addition to util_. The [directory]_SRCS and [directory]_OBJS variables are constructed by using the gmake "addprefix" function to add absolute paths for the source and object directories as prefixes to each relative path in the [directory]_ variable. The relevant lines in the file src/util/sources.mk look like this: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">util_SRCS=\
     $(addprefix $(SRC_DIR)/, $(util_))
util_OBJS=\
     $(addprefix $(OBJ_DIR)/, $(util_:.cpp=.o))
</pre></div><p> Here, SRC_DIR expands to the absolute path to the simpatico/src directory and OBJ_DIR expands to the absolute path to the object directory. The only difference between the paths in a [directory]_ variable (e.g., util_) and those in a [directory]_SRCS variable (e.g., util_SRCS) is thus that the [directory]_ variable contains relative paths, relative to src/, while the [directory]_SRCS variable contains corresponding absolute paths.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_patterns"></a>
Pattern Rules</h2>
<p>Each namespace level subdirectory of the src/ directory has a makefile fragment named "patterns.mk" that defines a pattern rule for compiling source files in that directory or namespace. The pattern rule has the same structure in all four namespace level directories, which looks like this: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">$(OBJ_DIR)/%.o:$(SRC_DIR)/%.cpp
        $(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) $(CPPDEFS) -c -o $@ $&lt;
ifdef MAKEDEP
        $(MAKEDEP) $(INCLUDES) $(CPPDEFS) $(MAKE_DEPS) -S$(SRC_DIR) -B$(OBJ_DIR) $&lt;
endif
</pre></div><p> The target pattern requires that an object file target with file extension *.o in a subdirectory of the object directory  can be created by compiling a *.cpp source file with the same base name in the corresponding subdirectory of the source directory . The first command actually compiles the source file and creates the object file. The second command, which is within an ifdef MAKEDEP .. endif block, generates a dependency file as a side-effect of compilation. Automatic generation of dependency files can be disabled by commenting out the definition of the variable MAKEDEP in the compiler.mk file.</p>
<p>The following variables used in the above pattern are defined in the compiler.mk file file in the object directory from which make was invoked:</p>
<ul>
<li>OBJ_DIR: Absolute path to the object directory</li>
<li>SRC_DIR: Absolute path to the simpatico/src directory</li>
<li>CXX: name of the C++ compiler executable</li>
<li>CPPFLAGS: flags for the C preprocessor</li>
<li>CXXFLAGS: general flags for the C++ compiler (optimization, warnings, etc.)</li>
<li>INCLUDES: directories to search for C++ header files, using the -I compiler option</li>
<li>MAKEDEP: Name of the script to generate dependency files (bin/makeDep by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>The same values are used for the above variables in all four namespaces. Two additional variables are defined within each patterns.mk file, and are assigned different values in different namespaces. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPPDEFS: String of all relevant C++ preprocessor macro definitions, defined using the compiler "-D" option</li>
<li>MAKE_DEPS: List of build configuration files that should be listed as dependencies for object files in this namespace</li>
</ul>
<p>The CPPDEFS variable, if not empty, contains a series of preprocessor macro definitions, defined using the "-D" option. Thus, for example, if debugging, bonds, and angles are enabled, and no other optional features, the value of CPPDEFS might expand within the file src/inter/patterns.mk to </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">CPPDEFS=-DUTIL_DEBUG -DINTER_BOND -DINTER_ANGLE
</pre></div><p> The code used to define CPPDEFS and MAKE_DEPS within the file src/inter/patterns.mk is shown below as an example: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="preprocessor"># C preprocessor macro definitions</span>
<span class="preprocessor"></span>CPPDEFS=$(UTIL_DEFS) $(INTER_DEFS)

<span class="preprocessor"># Dependencies of source files in src/inter on makefile fragments</span>
<span class="preprocessor"></span>MAKE_DEPS= -A$(OBJ_DIR)/compiler.mk
MAKE_DEPS+= -A$(OBJ_DIR)/util/defines.mk
MAKE_DEPS+= -A$(OBJ_DIR)/inter/defines.mk
</pre></div><p> The CPPDEFS variable expands to a concatenation of the NAMESPACE_DEFS variables (UTIL_DEFS, INTER_DEFS, etc.) for this namespace (i.e., INTER_DEFS) and for all namespaces upon which this depends (i.e., UTIL_DEFS). For the <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> namespace, this is a concatenation of  and . This yields a string containing all of the preprocessor definitions that are allowed to be used by code in the corresponding namespace.</p>
<p>The MAKE_DEPS variable contains a list of configuration files whose contents can effect the source code in this namespace. This list always contains the compiler.mk file, the defines.mk files for the namespace of interest, and the defines.mk files in any namespaces upon which this namespace depends. For the <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> namespace, MAKE_DEPS thus contains paths to the defines.mk files in the inter/ and util/ subdirectories. This list of files is added to the list of dependencies for every object file in this namespace, in addition to the usual list of header files, because changes to these build configuration files can change which preprocessor macros are defined, and thus can change the contents of the object files that are created by compilation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_dependency"></a>
Dependency Files</h2>
<p>If automatic dependency generation is not disabled, a dependency file will be generated for each source file immediately after the file is compiled, as a result of the second command in the pattern rule shown above. Each dependency file defines a makefile rule for constructing corresponding object (*.o) file target in the object directory. This rule can be used to determine when the source file needs to be recompiled as a result of changes in the files upon which it depends. The rule consists of the name of the object file target followed by a colon and list of files upon which it depends, of the form </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">class</span>.o: <span class="keyword">class</span>.cpp <span class="keyword">class</span>.h header1.h header2.h ....
</pre></div><p> The list of dependencies for each object (*.o) file target includes the corresponding source (*.cpp) file, all of the header files that this source file directly or indirectly includes, and the list of configuration files given by the variable MAKE_DEPS. Though not shown in the above example, all paths to the target and its dependencies are actually given as absolute paths in all dependency files. Each such makefile rule only lists dependencies, but does not contain an explicit command, because the required compiler command is given implicitly by the appropriate pattern rule.</p>
<p>Dependency files are normally created automatically, as a side-effect of compilation, by the executable script simpatico/bin/makeDep. The pattern rules defined in the namespace level patterns.mk files apply the makeDep script to a source file whenever that file is compiled, and thereby regenerate the associated dependency file. The "makeDep" script works by calling the gnu g++ compiler with the -MM option to calculate dependencies, and then using a separate python script to edit the resulting file.</p>
<p>In each makefile at the namespace level and below, all relevant dependency files are included into the makefile by a command of the form </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">-include $([directory]_OBJS:.o=.d)
</pre></div><p> in which [directory] represents the mangled name of the directory containing the makefile. For example, the file src/mcMd/makefile contains a line </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">-include $(mcMd_OBJS:.o=.d)
</pre></div><p> This line attempts to include a *.d dependency file for each *.o object file in the object file list. The dash in front of "include" instructs "make" to continue quietly if no dependency file is found for any object file target.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="make_subdirectory"></a>
Subdirectory Makefiles</h2>
<p>As a convenience for developers, every subdirectory src/ at the namespace level and below contains a makefile that can be used to compile just the the source files in the directory tree rooted at that subdirectory. The "all" target of the makefile in each such directory does an in-source build of only the source files in that directory and its descendant subdirectories.</p>
<p>During development, the most convenient way to compile a source file that you have just modified is usually to just enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">  &gt; make all
</pre></div><p> from the directory that contains the new source file. If automatic dependency generation is enabled, and if you are working on only one class in that directory at a time, this will normally cause the build system to compile only the source file that you have modified.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the file name conventions used in the build system make it difficult to explictly compile a single source file. The Simpatico build system uses absolute paths for all file paths. The "make" program is not smart enough to recognize when an absolute and relative path are equivalent. As a result, the only way explicitly compile a single source file would be to use the absolute path to the object file as a makefile target. For example, if the absolute path to the root simpatico directory within a user account named "george" was "/home/george/simpatico/", you (or George) could compile the source file <a class="el" href="mcMd_2simulation_2Simulation_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/simulation/Simulation.cpp</a> by entering </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">  make /home/george/simpatico/src/mcMd/simulation/Simulation.o
</pre></div><p> from either the src/mcMd/simulation or the src/mcMd/ directory. Most programmers are unwilling to type absolute paths, which is why we recommend just typing "make all" from the directory that contains the file of interest. To use "make all" in this way during development, however, you can only work on one file in each directory at a time. If a directory contains more than one incomplete or broken file, you simply need to comment out all but one of these (the one you are working on) in the value of the [directory]_ variable in the corresponding sources.mk file, until you are ready to complete or fix them.</p>
