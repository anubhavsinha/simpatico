<p>Simpatico is compiled using a system of unix makefiles. All development was done using gnu make (gmake). We have never checked if the build system works with other variants of make (though it very well might).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_files"></a>
Source File and Namespace Conventions</h1>
<p>All C++ files for Simpatico, including both header (*.h) and source (*.cpp) files, are in subdirectories of the src/ directory. The header and source file for each class are in the same directory. The name of each such file is the same as the class name, followed by the extension .h or .cpp. All class names and corresponding file names are upper space camel (like <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1Vector.html" title="A Vector is a Cartesian vector.">Util::Vector</a> or McMd::FileMaster). When each source file is compiled, the resulting object (*.o) file is placed in the same directory as the source file, using the same base name, with a .o extension. When automatic dependency generation is enabled, a dependency file with the same base name and a suffix *.d is also created for each source file as a side effect of compilation.</p>
<p>The src/util, src/inter, src/mcMd, and src/ddMd directories each contain the code for a different C++ namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>src/util/ contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>src/inter/ contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>src/mcMd/ contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>src/ddMd contains the <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace</li>
</ul>
<p>These four directories will thus be referred to in what follows as "namespace" level directories.</p>
<p>By convention, classes in the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace may use names defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> namespace, but classes in the <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace do not use names defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace, and classes in the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace may not use names defined in the <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> namespace. Classes in namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> may use names defined in namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a>, but not names defined in <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> or <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a>. We may summarize these relationships by speaking of one namespace being "dependent" on another:</p>
<ul>
<li>namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> depends on namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> depends on namespaces <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>namespace <a class="el" href="namespaceDdMd.html" title="Parallel domain decomposition (DD) molecular dynamics MD simulation.">DdMd</a> depends on namespaces <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main program <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">mdSim.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="mcSim_8cpp_source.html">mcSim.cpp</a> for single processor operation are in the src/mcMd directory. The main program <a class="el" href="ddSim_8cpp_source.html">ddSim.cpp</a> for parallel MD simulations is in the src/ddMd directory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_main"></a>
Main makefile</h1>
<p>The file src/makefile is the main makefile. It has three main makefile targets, "mcMd", "mcMd-mpi" and "ddMd". The "mcMd" and "mdMd-mpi" target build single-processor and multi-processor versions of the mcSim and mdSim executables, respectively. The "ddMd" target builds the ddSim parallel MD executable.</p>
<p>Entering "make mcMd" or "make mcMd-mpi" from the src/ directory will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the configure script to disable MPI (for "make mcMd") or enable MPI (for "make mcMd-mpi"), as required.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recursively invoke "make all" from within the util/, inter/, and mcMd/ namespace level directories. This will compile all of the classes in these directories and construct associated static libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Invoking "make all" from within the mcMd/ directory also compiles and links links the main programs <a class="el" href="mcSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mcSim.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp</a>, to create a pair of executable programs for MC and MD simulation. By default, the single-processor executables created by "make mcMd" are named mcSim and mdSim, and the multiprocessor executables created by "make mcMd-mpi" are named mcSim_m and mdSim_m.</p>
<p>Entering "make ddMd" from the src/ directory will instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the configure script to enable MPI.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recursively invoke make all from with the util/, inter/, and mcMd/ namespace level directories, thus compiling all of the classes in these directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "all" target in the ddMd/ directory also compile and links the main program src/ddMd/ddMd.cpp to create an executable named ddSim for parallel MD simulation</p>
<p>By default, all static library files are placed in the simpatico/lib/ directory, and the executable files are placed in the simpatico/bin/ directory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_namespace"></a>
Namespace Level Makefiles</h1>
<p>Each of the four namespace level directories src/util, src/inter, src/mcMd and src/ddMd has a makefile with an "all" target. The action associated with the "all" target in any namespace level directory will:</p>
<ul>
<li>compile all of the class source files in the associated directory tree, or in the associated namespace, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>build a static library that contains compiled object code for all classes in that namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "all" targets in the files src/mcMd/makefile and src/ddMd/makefile also build associated executables:</p>
<ul>
<li>"make all" from src/mcMd also compiles and links <a class="el" href="mcSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mcSim.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="mdSim_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp</a> to create mcSim and mdSim executables.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"make all" from src/ddMd also compiles and links <a class="el" href="ddSim_8cpp_source.html">src/ddMd/ddSim.cpp</a> to create the ddSim executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each namespace level directory has three makefile fragments named "patterns.mk", "sources.mk" and "defines.mk" that are included in the associated namespace level makefile, as well as in other makefiles. In each namespace-level directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file patterns.mk defines a pattern rule for compiling class source files in the associated namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The file sources.mk defines makefile variables that list all class source (*.cpp) files and all object file (*.o) targets in the namespace</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The file defines.mk defines preprocessor macros that effects conditional compilation of the code in that namespace</li>
</ul>
<p>The makefile in each namespace level directory includes the src/compiler.mk file, and the patterns.mk, sources.mk, and defines.mk fragments from the directory that contains the makefile. The makefile in each namespace level directory also includes sources.mk and defines.mk files from any other namespace upon which the associated namespace depends. For example, because the <a class="el" href="namespaceMcMd.html" title="Classes for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MC) simulation.">McMd</a> namespace depends upon the <a class="el" href="namespaceUtil.html" title="Utility classes for scientific computation.">Util</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceInter.html" title="Classes that define potential energy interaction functions.">Inter</a> namespaces, the file src/mcMd/makefile includes the sources.mk and defines.mk files from the src/inter and src/util directories, in addition to those from the src/mcMd directory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_subdirectory"></a>
Subdirectory Makefiles</h1>
<p>Every subdirectory within the directory tree rooted at a namespace level source code directory also contains a makefile. Each such makefile includes the same set of makefile fragments as those included by the parent namespace level makefile. The "all" target of each such subdirectory makefile compiles all of the class source files in the directory tree rooted at the subdirectory that contains the makefile.</p>
<p>The main difference between the makefiles in namespace level directories and those in subdirectories is that the "all" target in the namespace level directories creates a static library and (in some cases) builds one or more executables, in addition to compiling all of the source files in the directory tree.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_sources"></a>
Source File Lists</h1>
<p>Every directory of src/ at the namespace level and below contains a makefile fragment named "sources.mk". Each such file defines defines two variables that expand into lists of source and object files. These variables have names of the form [directory]_SRCS and [directory]_OBJS, respectively. Here, [directory] represents a mangled form of the directory name, which is constructed by taking the path from the src/ directory to the subdirectory of interest and replacing each "/" directory separator by an underscore ("_"). For example, the namespace level file src/util/sources.mk defines variables util_SRCS and util_OBJS, while the subdirectory file src/util/space/sources.mk defines variables util_space_SRCS and util_space_OBJS. In each such directory, the variable [directory]_SRCS expands into a list of paths to the all of the source (*.cpp) files in the directory tree rooted at that directory, including those in subdirectories, and [directory]_OBJS expands into a list of all of the corresponding *.o object file targets.</p>
<p>In directories that contain source files, source file paths are listed in the sources.mk file using absolute paths in which the makefile variable SRC_DIR is used to represent the absolute path to the src/ directory. For example, here is the full text of the file src/util/space/sources.mk: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">util_space_SRCS=\</div>
<div class="line">    $(SRC_DIR)/util/space/Grid.cpp \</div>
<div class="line">    $(SRC_DIR)/util/space/IntVector.cpp \</div>
<div class="line">    $(SRC_DIR)/util/space/Tensor.cpp \</div>
<div class="line">    $(SRC_DIR)/util/space/Vector.cpp </div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">util_space_OBJS=$(util_space_SRCS:.cpp=.o)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The directory src/util/space contains three sources files named <a class="el" href="Grid_8cpp_source.html">Grid.cpp</a>, <a class="el" href="IntVector_8cpp_source.html">IntVector.cpp</a>, <a class="el" href="Vector_8cpp_source.html">Vector.cpp</a> and <a class="el" href="Tensor_8cpp_source.html">Tensor.cpp</a>, and has no subdirectories. In the definition of the variable util_spaces_SRCS, absolute paths are given for each of these source files by using SRC_DIR to represent the absolute path to the simpatico src/ directory, followed by the path from src/ to a particular source file.</p>
<p>The variable SRC_DIR is set to the absolute path to the src/ directory in the file src/compiler.mk. The file src/compiler.mk is included by every makefile, and is always included before any sources.mk files, thus guaranteeing that a value is always available. The correct value for SRC_DIR is set by the "setup" script during initial setup, before trying to compile any code.</p>
<p>The [directory]_OBJS variable in each sources.mk file is defined by a substitution pattern that simply replaces the file extension *.cpp by *.o in every file name listed in the corresponding [directory]_SRCS variable. In the above example, util_space_OBJS is defined by the pattern </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">util_space_OBJS=$(util_space_SRCS:.cpp=.o)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> which simply replaces the file extension ".cpp" by ".o" in every path listed in the variable util_space_SRCS.</p>
<p>In directories that contain subdirectories, the source file list is constructed recursively, by concatenating corresponding lists defined in subdirectories. In each directory at the namespace level and below that contains subdirectories, the parent directory "sources.mk" file includes the sources.mk file from each of its subdirectories. The value of the [directory]_SRCS variable for the parent directory is then constructed by concatenating values of the [subdirectory]_SRCS variables defined in the subdirectories, and then adding paths for any source files in the parent directory. For example, here is the source of the namespace level file src/util/sources.mk, which includes the file src/util/space/sources.mk shown above (among others): </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/misc/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/format/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/memory/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/containers/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/mpi/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/signal/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/param/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/math/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/space/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/random/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/boundary/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/crystal/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/ensembles/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/accumulators/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line">include $(SRC_DIR)/util/archives/sources.mk</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">util_SRCS=$(util_misc_SRCS) $(util_format_SRCS) \</div>
<div class="line">    $(util_memory_SRCS) $(util_containers_SRCS) $(util_mpi_SRCS) \</div>
<div class="line">    $(util_signal_SRCS) $(util_param_SRCS) $(util_math_SRCS) \</div>
<div class="line">    $(util_space_SRCS) $(util_random_SRCS) $(util_boundary_SRCS) \</div>
<div class="line">    $(util_crystal_SRCS) $(util_ensembles_SRCS) \</div>
<div class="line">    $(util_accumulators_SRCS) $(util_archives_SRCS)</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">util_OBJS=$(util_SRCS:.cpp=.o)</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">$(util_LIB): $(util_OBJS)</div>
<div class="line">   $(AR) rcs $(util_LIB) $(util_OBJS)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The first segment of the file is a set of include statements that include the sources.mk files from all subdirectories of src/util. The line that defines util_SRCS then simply concatenates the [directory]_SRCS variables defined in all of the subdirectory sources.mk files. The definition of util_OBJS again uses a substition pattern to replace .cpp by .o in every file name in util_SRCS. The last line of this file defines a rule to construct a static library that will contain all of the object files. The name of the library is given by the variable util_LIB, which is defined in the file src/util/defines.mk.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_newfile"></a>
How to add a new source file</h1>
<p>To add a new source file to the makefile system, one must simply add the path to the *.cpp source file in the sources.mk file in the directory that contains the new source file. The path to a new source file should be given in the form discussed above, using  to represent the src/ directory. Adding a new source file to the [directory]_SRCS variable in the directory that contains the new file is enough to guarantee that this file will be added to the corresponding source file lists in all parent directories, up to the namespace level.</p>
<p>If a class or a set of functions is defined in a header file that is not compiled separately, it does not need to be added to the build system. The source file list only contains files that are compiled separately.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_dependency"></a>
Dependency Files</h1>
<p>When automatic dependency generation is enabled, a dependency file will be generated for each source file when the file is compiled. Each dependency file is generated as a side-effect of compilation, as dictated by the patterns rules given in the namespace level patterns.mk files. The dependency file associated with a source file has the same base name as the source file, with an extension *.d rather than *.cpp, and is placed in the same directory as the source (*.cpp) and object (*.o) files.</p>
<p>Each dependency file defines a makefile rule for the corresponding object (*.o) file target. The rule consists of the name of the object file target followed by a colon and list of files upon which it depends, of the form </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span>.o: <span class="keyword">class</span>.cpp <span class="keyword">class</span>.h header1.h header2.h ....</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The list of dependencies for each object (*.o) file target includes both the corresponding source (*.cpp) file and all of the header files that this source file directly or indirectly includes. The makefile rule to construct an object file lists dependencies but does not contain an explicit compiler command, because the command that invokes the compiler is given implicitly by a pattern rule defined in the namespace level patterns.mk file.</p>
<p>If automatic dependency generation has been enabled, dependency files are created as a side-effect of compilation, using the executable script bin/makeDep. The pattern rules defined in the namespace level patterns.mk files apply the makeDep script to a source file whenever that file is compiled, and thereby regenerate the associated dependency file. The "makeDep" script works by calling the gnu g++ compiler with the -MM option to calculate dependencies, and then using a separate python script to edit the resulting file by modifying the form of the paths for the target and dependency files.</p>
<p>Though not shown in the above example, all file paths in the dependency files generated by this system are literal absolute paths. This is different from the convention used in the sources.mk files, which also use absolute paths, but in which absolute paths are expressed in a more portable form by using  to represent the path to the src/ directory. Paths in the sources.mk must be expressed in a portable form because these files are stored in the repository. Literal absolute paths may be used in dependency files because these files generated by the user as a side-effect of compilation, and thus do not need not be portable.</p>
<p>In each makefile at the namespace level and below, all relevant dependency files are included into the makefile by a command of the form </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">-include $([directory]_OBJS:.o=.d)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> in which [directory] represents the mangled name of the directory containing the makefile. For example, in the file src/mcMd/mdSimulation, this line is </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">-include $(mcMd_mdSimulation_OBJS:.o=.d)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This line attempts to include a *.d dependency file for each *.o object file in the object file list. The dash in front of "include" instructs "make" to continue quietly if no dependency file is found for any of the object files listed in the object file list.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="make_single"></a>
How to compile a single source file</h1>
<p>The most convenient way to compile a source file that you have just modified is usually to just enter </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make all</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the directory containing that source file. If automatic dependency generation is enabled, and if you are working on only one class in that directory at a time, this will normally cause the build system to compile only the source file that you have modified.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the file name conventions used in the build system make it awkward to explictly compile a single source file. The Simpatico build system uses absolute paths for all file paths. The "make" program is not smart enough to recognize when an absolute and relative path are equivalent. As a result, the only way explicitly compile a single source file would be to use the absolute path to the object file as a makefile target. For example, if the absolute path to the root simpatico directory within a user account named "george" was "/home/george/simpatico/", you (or George) could compile the source file <a class="el" href="mcMd_2simulation_2Simulation_8cpp_source.html">src/mcMd/simulation/Simulation.cpp</a> by entering </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">make /home/george/simpatico/src/mcMd/simulation/Simulation.o</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the src/mcMd/simulation or the src/mcMd/ directory. Typing "make Simulation.o" from the src/mcMd/simulation directory will not work, however, because make is not smart enough to recognize that the relative path Simulation.o is equivalent to the absolute path /home/george/simpatico/src/mcMd/simulation/Simulation.o.</p>
<p>Most programmers find it a nuisance to type absolute paths. This is why we recommend just typing "make all" from the directory that contains the file of interest, and relying on make and automatic dependency generation to figure out which file needs to be recompiled. To use "make all" in this way during development, however, you can only work on one file in each directory at a time. If a directory contains more than one incomplete or broken file, you simply need to comment out all but one of these (the one you are working on) in the value of the variable [directory]_SRCS in the sources.mk file, until you are ready to complete or fix them.</p>
