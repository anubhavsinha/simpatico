<p>Simpatico provides extensible facilities for evaluating and analyzing a variety of physical properties either "on the fly", during a simulation, or by postprocessing of configurations that have been dumped to file during an earlier simulation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="analysis_onthefly_section"></a>
On-the-fly Analysis</h2>
<p>All three simpatico simulation programs allow some properties to be evaluated and analyzed during a simulation, on-the-fly. Classes that are used for data analysis in mcSim and mdSim are subclasses of the <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Analyzer.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">McMd::Analyzer</a> base class. Classes used for data analysis in ddSim are subclasses of <a class="el" href="classDdMd_1_1Analyzer.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">DdMd::Analyzer</a>. A typical analyzer class, in either namespace, evaluates one or more physical properties of interest, and either outputs a sequence of values to an associated file for later analysis or updates one or more statistical accumulators in order to accumulate, e.g., averages, autocorrelation functions, histograms etc. Source code for the analyzer classes that are distributed with Simpatico can be found in the src/mcMd/analyzers and src/ddMd/analyzer directories. Users may create new analyzer classes as needed.</p>
<p>The choice of which analyzer operations (if any) should be executed during an simulation is specified for each type of simulation by the AnalyzerManager block of the parameter file. The AnalyzerManager block of the parameter file contains a "baseInterval" parameter (explained below), followed by a sequence of zero or more polymorphic subbblocks. Each polymorphic subblock contains the parameter file block for an analyzer that should be applied during the simulation. Any number of analyzers may be added to a simulation in this way.</p>
<p>Each subclass of either <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Analyzer.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">McMd::Analyzer</a> or <a class="el" href="classDdMd_1_1Analyzer.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">DdMd::Analyzer</a> must re-implement a pure virtual method named sample(), which is invoked periodically during a simulation. The sample() method usually evaluates a physical property, and may either write data to an associated file or update a statistical accumulator, or both.</p>
<p>The sample() method of each analyzer is called only when the step counter is an integer multiple of the number of an integer "interval" parameter. The step counter and interval represents count MD time steps or attempted MC Markov moves during a simulation. The interval parameter may be assigned different values for different analyzers, but must always be a multiple of a "baseInterval" parameter that appears as the first line within the AnalyzerManager block.</p>
<p>The parameter file block associated with each subclass of <a class="el" href="classMcMd_1_1Analyzer.html" title="Abstract base for periodic output and/or analysis actions.">McMd::Analyzer</a> contains an interval parameter. Most analyzers also write data to an associated output file, either during the simulation or as a summary at the end of a simulation, and thus require an output file name as a parameter. Many analyzers require other input parameters as wel. See <a class="el" href="user_features_page.html">here</a> for links to documentation of the parameter file formats for specific analyzers.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="analysis_configWrite_section"></a>
Dumping Configurations to File</h2>
<p>The McMd::WriteConfig (for mcSim and mdSim simulations) and <a class="el" href="classDdMd_1_1WriteConfig.html" title="Periodically write simulation configuration to a new file.">DdMd::WriteConfig</a> (for ddMd simulations) analyzer classes write system configurations to file at regular intervals, for later post-processing. These classes write each configuration to a separate file. The name of each file is constructed by concatenating the outputPrefix, a base name that is specified in the parameter file block for the DumpConfig or WriteConfig class, and a sequential integer counter that is incremented by 1 after each file is written. These WriteConfig classes use the same file format as that used by the WRITE_CONFIG command to write final configuration. If no format is specified, a default configuration file format will be used. A different format may be specified by placing SET_CONFIG_IO command with the appropriate ConfigIo subclass name as an argument in the command file before the SIMULATE command.</p>
<p>The McMd::WriteTrajectory and DdMd::WriteTrajectory analyzer classes instead write a sequence of configurations as frames within a single MD "trajectory" file.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="analysis_mcMd_postprocess_section"></a>
Postprocessing mcSim and mdSim simulations</h2>
<p>The mcSim and mdSim programs can both be used to postprocess configurations that have been dumped to file. These programs can postprocess either by mcSim or mdSim or (with some restrictions on the form of the output) by ddSim. To so, each program simply implements a main loop, analogous to the main simulation loop, in which a sequence of configurations are read from file, but in which the resulting set of configurations is treated exactly as if they were generated during a simulation. The same set of analyzer classes are available for use in this mode as those available for use on-the-fly. To use either of these programs in this mode, one must provide a parameter file very similar to that used for a simulation, with a AnalyzerManager that specifies a set of analyzers that should be applied, and a command file in which the "SIMULATE" command is replaced by either a "ANALYZE_DUMPS" or "ANALYZE_TRAJECTORY" command.</p>
<p>The ANALYZE_DUMPS command in the command file for mcSim or mdSim causes the program to read in and analyze a sequence of numbered configuration files. The names of the input configuration files are constructed by concatenating the inputPrefix parameter of the FileMaster, a base name that is specified as an argument to the ANALYZE_DUMPS command and an integer in a range that is specified in the ANALYZE command. For example, if the inputPrefix of the FileMaster was set to out/ (because this was the output prefix used by a previous simulation), and the outputPrefix was set to analyze/, the command </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">   ANALYZE_DUMPS  0   19   dump/config
</pre></div><p> would cause the main McSimulation or MdSimulation object to read in and apply all of the specified analyzers to configurations files with names out/dump/config.0 out/dump/config.1 ... in/dump/config.19, and write the results of the analysis to files in the analyze/ directory.</p>
<p>The ANALYZE_TRAJECTORY command in a command file for mdSim causes the program to read and analyze a trajectory file that contains a sequence of system configurations ("frames"). The syntax of the command is identical to that of the ANALYZE_DUMPS command. This command is not available for use by mcSim.</p>
<p>During postprocessing, the "interval" of each analyzer is interpreted as a number of configurations to be read from file between subsequent calls of the sample method, rather than the number of MD or MC steps. Unless configurations were written to file more frequently than necessary, the interval for each analyzers should thus generally be set to 1 in the parameter file for a postprocessing run.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="analysis_ddMd_postprocess_section"></a>
Postprocessing ddSim simulations</h2>
<p>Unlike mcSim and mdSim, the ddSim program is not designed to be able to postprocess its own outputs. The reason for this is that ddSim is a parallel program, but many common types of analysis are easier to implement in a serial program. Currently, configurations that have been dumped to file by a ddSim simulation can be postprocessed by using the serial mcSim or mdSim program as a postprocessor, if certain conventions are obeyed when constructing the ddSim configuration, as discussed below. A new serial program named mdPp (molecular dynamics post-processor) has also been written specifically for postprocessing ddSim trajectories, but is still experimental.</p>
<p>The mcSim and mdSim programs can be used to analyze the output of ddSim simulations of molecular and atomic liquids if and only if the following conventions are respected in the ddSim configuration and output files. (1) Configuration must be output using the <a class="el" href="classDdMd_1_1DdMdOrderedConfigIo.html" title="Native / default format for configuration files.">DdMd::DdMdOrderedConfigIo</a>, which outputs atoms in order by their global atom id. Atom ids must be consecutive, starting from 0. (2) The ddSim configuration may only contain molecules of the types specified in the mcSim or mdSim parameter file format. (3) the number of molecules of each type must exactly equal the capacity specified for that species in the mcSim or mdSim parameter file. (4) Atoms within each molecule must be listed consecutively, in the order assumed by the mcSim or mdSim species definition, with all molecules of the first species listed first, followed by all molecules of the second species, etc. In order for this to work, these constraints on the connectivity and numbering of atoms that must be satisfied by the input configuration file used to initialize the ddSim simulation. When mcSim or mdSim are used to analyze a ddSim simulation, the information about groups in a ddSim configuration file is ignored, and is simply assumed to yield the same topology as that specified by the species definitions in the parameter file.</p>
<p>The mdPp program is a new serial program that was designed specifically for postprocessing ddSim simulation trajectories. Unlike mcSim and mdSim, it can read the sections of a ddim configuration file that specify molecular connectivity, and need not make such strong assumptions about molecular structure or the format of the configuration file. Classes that implement analysis algorithms for mdPp must be subclasses of spAn::Analyzer base class. At the time of writing, however, we have not yet written any nontrivial analyzer classes for this program. This program will become rapidly more useful as analyzers are written.</p>
