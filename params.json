{"body":"/*\r\n* Simpatico - Simulation Package for Polymeric and Molecular Liquids\r\n*\r\n* Copyright 2010, David Morse (morse@cems.umn.edu)\r\n* Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.\r\n*/\r\n\r\nSimpatico is a C++ package for Monte Carlo (MC), Molecular Dynamics \r\n(MD) and hybrid MD/MC simulations of classical mechanical models of\r\npolymeric and molecular liquids. It contains:\r\n\r\n- Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) \r\n  simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.\r\n\r\n- A program for parallel MD simulations, named ddSim.\r\n\r\nThe parallel MD program ddSim uses a domain (or spatial) \r\ndecomposition algorithm for parallelization.\r\n\r\nThe design of Simpatico was motivated by the following goals: \r\n\r\n- Extensibility: New algorithms may be added for most elements \r\n  of a simulation via C++ inheritance, without modifying the \r\n  core source code. Extensible elements include Monte Carlo \r\n  moves, molecular dynamics integrators, potential energy \r\n  functions, molecular species, data analysis algorithms, and \r\n  configuration file formats.\r\n\r\n- Efficiency: Simpatico is designed to be competitive as a tool \r\n  for computationally demanding research projects. \r\n\r\n- Integrating Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics:\r\n  The single processor mcSim and mdSim programs provide efficient\r\n  implementations of MC, MD, and hybrid integration algorithms, \r\n  based on a shared code base. \r\n\r\n- Integrated data analysis: mcSim and mdSim come bundled with \r\n  a set of data analysis classes that can be used either \r\n  \"on-the-fly\", during a simulation, or for post-processing.\r\n   \r\nSimpatico source code may be obtained either by download from \r\nthe project website\r\n<http://research.cems.umn.edu/morse/code/simpatico/home.php> \r\nor by cloning a copy of the git version control repository.  \r\nThe code is standard C++ and must be compiled from source. \r\nMulti-processor programs (ddSim and multi-processor versions \r\nof mcSim and mdSim) require an MPI library.\r\n\r\nWeb documentation is provided with downloadable releases, in the \r\ndirectory simpatico/doc/html, but is not retained in the git \r\nrepository. Instructions for regenerating the html documentation,\r\nif needed, is given below. A copy of the html docmentation is \r\nalso accessible via the Simpatico web page.\r\n\r\nCompiling:\r\n----------\r\n\r\nInstructions for compiling Simpatico are given in the text file \r\nsimpatico/doc/dox/compile.dox, or in the corresponding html web \r\npage in the doc/html directory, which is generated from this text \r\nfile.  Short instructions for compiling the default single-processor \r\nversions of mcSim and mdSim (for the impatient) are:\r\n\r\n- cd to the simpatico/ root directory\r\n\r\n- Enter \"./configure\" to run a configure script\r\n\r\n- cd to the src/ directory\r\n\r\n- Enter \"make mcMd\".\r\n\r\nThe resulting executables, name \"mcSim\" and \"mdSim\", will be \r\ninstalled in the simpatico/bin directory. Further instructions\r\nfor compiling multi-processor programs, and for enabling or\r\ndisabling various features, are given in the file \r\nsimpatico/dox/dox/compile.dox and in the corresponding html page. \r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWeb documentation for Simpatico is prepared using the Doxygen \r\nutility (www.doxygen.org). Doxygen creates html web pages that \r\nare deposited in the directory doc/html/.  These pages are created \r\nfrom comments extracted from the C++ source code, and from a set \r\nof *.dox files in the directory simpatico/doc/dox/, which contain \r\nthe text for a set of introductory web pages. These *.dox files \r\nare readable in any text editor.  The html pages are included in \r\nthe downloadable distribution, but are not retained in the git \r\nrepository.  \r\n\r\nIf you are using a downloaded version, you can read the web\r\ndocumentation by pointing a browser at any *.html file in the \r\ndirectory simpatico/doc/html, and then using the links at the \r\ntop of any page to navigate to the main manual page.  The html \r\nfile for the main page is named index.html.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a clone of the git source code repository, you \r\ncan use dOxygen to regenerate the html documentation.  The file \r\nsimpatico/doc/dox/compile.dox contains instructions for how to\r\ndo so. This requires that dOxygen be installed and that the\r\nexecutable be in a directory in your PATH. The basic instructions \r\n(after dOxygen is installed) are:\r\n\r\n  - cd to the simpatico/doc directory\r\n  - Enter \"make doc\"\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
