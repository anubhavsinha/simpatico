</ul><p>Simpatico is a C++ package for Monte Carlo (MC), Molecular Dynamics 
(MD) and hybrid MD/MC simulations of classical mechanical models of
polymeric and molecular liquids. It contains:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.</p></li>
<li><p>A program for parallel MD simulations, named ddSim.</p></li>
</ul><p>The parallel MD program ddSim uses a domain (or spatial) 
decomposition algorithm for parallelization.</p>

<p>The design of Simpatico was motivated by the following goals: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Extensibility: New algorithms may be added for most elements 
of a simulation via C++ inheritance, without modifying the 
core source code. Extensible elements include Monte Carlo 
moves, molecular dynamics integrators, potential energy 
functions, molecular species, data analysis algorithms, and 
configuration file formats.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficiency: Simpatico is designed to be competitive as a tool 
for computationally demanding research projects. </p></li>
<li><p>Integrating Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics:
The single processor mcSim and mdSim programs provide efficient
implementations of MC, MD, and hybrid integration algorithms, 
based on a shared code base. </p></li>
<li><p>Integrated data analysis: mcSim and mdSim come bundled with 
a set of data analysis classes that can be used either 
"on-the-fly", during a simulation, or for post-processing.</p></li>
</ul><p>Simpatico source code may be obtained either by download from 
the project website
<a href="http://research.cems.umn.edu/morse/code/simpatico/home.php">http://research.cems.umn.edu/morse/code/simpatico/home.php</a> 
or by cloning a copy of the git version control repository.<br>
The code is standard C++ and must be compiled from source. 
Multi-processor programs (ddSim and multi-processor versions 
of mcSim and mdSim) require an MPI library.</p>

<p>Web documentation is provided with downloadable releases, in the 
directory simpatico/doc/html, but is not retained in the git 
repository. Instructions for regenerating the html documentation,
if needed, is given below. A copy of the html docmentation is 
also accessible via the Simpatico web page.</p>

<h2>Compiling:</h2>

<p>Instructions for compiling Simpatico are given in the text file 
simpatico/doc/dox/compile.dox, or in the corresponding html web 
page in the doc/html directory, which is generated from this text 
file.  Short instructions for compiling the default single-processor 
versions of mcSim and mdSim (for the impatient) are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>cd to the simpatico/ root directory</p></li>
<li><p>Enter "./configure" to run a configure script</p></li>
<li><p>cd to the src/ directory</p></li>
<li><p>Enter "make mcMd".</p></li>
</ul><p>The resulting executables, name "mcSim" and "mdSim", will be 
installed in the simpatico/bin directory. Further instructions
for compiling multi-processor programs, and for enabling or
disabling various features, are given in the file 
simpatico/dox/dox/compile.dox and in the corresponding html page. </p>

<h2>Documentation:</h2>

<p>Web documentation for Simpatico is prepared using the Doxygen 
utility (<a href="http://www.doxygen.org">www.doxygen.org</a>). Doxygen creates html web pages that 
are deposited in the directory doc/html/.  These pages are created 
from comments extracted from the C++ source code, and from a set 
of *.dox files in the directory simpatico/doc/dox/, which contain 
the text for a set of introductory web pages. These *.dox files 
are readable in any text editor.  The html pages are included in 
the downloadable distribution, but are not retained in the git 
repository.  </p>

<p>If you are using a downloaded version, you can read the web
documentation by pointing a browser at any *.html file in the 
directory simpatico/doc/html, and then using the links at the 
top of any page to navigate to the main manual page.  The html 
file for the main page is named index.html.</p>

<p>If you are using a clone of the git source code repository, you 
can use dOxygen to regenerate the html documentation.  The file 
simpatico/doc/dox/compile.dox contains instructions for how to
do so. This requires that dOxygen be installed and that the
executable be in a directory in your PATH. The basic instructions 
(after dOxygen is installed) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>cd to the simpatico/doc directory</li>
<li>Enter "make doc"</li>
</ul>
