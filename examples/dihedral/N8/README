All simulations in this directory tree are simulations of 100 
chains of 8 atoms each with angle and dihedral potentials. 
All of these examples use one of two initial configuration 
files in the "in/" subdirectory of this directory. 

These simulations all require versions of the main programs
that have been compiled with angle and dihedral potentials 
enabled. These can be created by cd'ing to bld/parallel, for
parallel programs, or bld/serial, for serial programs, and
entering

> ./configure -a1 -d1

before recompiling these programs. The names of the resulting 
executable names, such as mdSim_a_d, will then include a 
string "_a_d" to indicate that these features have been 
enabled.
